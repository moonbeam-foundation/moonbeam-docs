# How to Build a DApp: Complete DApp Architecture

![Learn about the entire architecture of DApps.](/images/tutorials/eth-api/how-to-build-a-dapp/how-to-build-a-dapp-banner.png)
_by Jeremy Boetticher_

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Decentralized applications, or DApps, have redefined how applications are built, managed, and interacted with in Web3. By leveraging blockchain technology, DApps provide a secure, transparent, and trustless system that enables peer-to-peer interactions without any central authority. At the core of a DApp's architecture are several main components that work in tandem to create a robust, decentralized ecosystem. These components include smart contracts, nodes, frontend user interfaces, and more.  

![DApp Architecture Diagram](/images/tutorials/eth-api/how-to-build-a-dapp/how-to-build-a-dapp-1.png)

In this tutorial, you'll come face-to-face with each major component by writing a full DApp that mints tokens. We'll also explore additional optional components of DApps that can enhance user experience for your future projects. You can view the complete project in its [monorepo on GitHub](https://github.com/jboetticher/complete-example-dapp){target=_blank}.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites } 

To get started, you should have the following:

 - A Moonbase Alpha account funded with DEV. 
  --8<-- 'text/faucet/faucet-list-item.md'
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/){target=_blank} version 16 or newer installed
 - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target=_blank} with Juan Blanco's [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity){target=_blank} is a recommended IDE
 - Understanding of JavaScript and React
 - Novice familiarity with Solidity. If you are not familiar with writing Solidity, there are many resources out there, including [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/){target=_blank}. A 15-minute skim should suffice for this tutorial
 - A wallet like [MetaMask installed](/tokens/connect/metamask){target=_blank}

## Nodes and JSON-RPC Endpoints {: #nodes-and-json-rpc-endpoints }

Generally speaking, a JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that utilizes JSON to encode data. For Web3, they refer to the specific JSON-RPCs that DApp developers use to send requests and receive responses from blockchain nodes, making it a crucial element in interactions with smart contracts. They allow frontend user interfaces to seamlessly interact with the smart contracts and provide users with real-time feedback on their actions. They also allow developers to deploy their smart contracts in the first place!  

To get a JSON-RPC to communicate with a Moonbeam blockchain, you need to run a node. But that can be expensive, complicated, and a hassle. Fortunately, as long as you have *access* to a node, you can interact with the blockchain. Moonbase Alpha has a [handful of free and paid node options](/learn/platform/networks/moonbase/#network-endpoints){target=_blank}. For this tutorial, we will be using the Moonbeam Foundation's public node for Moonbase Alpha, but you are encouraged to get your own [private endpoint](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=_blank}.  

```
{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}
```

So now you have a URL. How do you use it? Over `HTTPS`, JSON-RPC requests are `POST` requests that include specific methods for reading and writing data, such as `eth_call` for executing a smart contract function in a read-only manner or `eth_sendRawTransaction` for submitting signed transactions to the network (calls that change the blockchain state). The entire JSON request structure will always have a structure similar to the following:  

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_getBalance",
  "params": ["0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac", "latest"]
}
```

This example is getting the balance (in DEV on Moonbase Alpha) of the `0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac` account. Let's break down the elements:  

- `jsonrpc` — the JSON-RPC API version, usually "2.0"
- `id` — an integer value that helps identify a response to a request. Can usually just keep it as `
- `method` — the specific method to read/write data from/to the blockchain. You can see many of the [RPC methods on our docs site](/builders/get-started/eth-compare/rpc-support){target=_blank}
- `params` — an array of the input parameters expected by the specific `method`  

There are also additional elements that can be added to JSON-RPC requests, but those four will be seen the most often.  

Now, these JSON-RPC requests are pretty useful, but when writing code, it can be a hassle to create a JSON object over and over again. That's why there exist libraries that help abstract and facilitate the usage of these requests. Moonbeam provides [documentation on many libraries](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries){target=_blank}, and the one that we will be using in this tutorial is [Ethers.js](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries/ethersjs){target=_blank}. Just understand that whenever we interact with the blockchain through the Ethers.js package, we're really using JSON-RPC!  

## Smart Contracts {: #smart-contracts }

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They serve as the decentralized backend of any DApp, automating and enforcing the business logic within the system.  

If coming from traditional web development, smart contracts are meant to replace the backend with important caveats: the user must have the native currency (GLMR, MOVR, DEV, etc.) to make state-changing requests, storing information can be expensive, and **no information stored is private**.  

When you deploy a smart contract onto Moonbeam, you upload a series of instructions that can be understood by the EVM, or the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Whenever someone interacts with a smart contract, these transparent, tamper-proof, and immutable instructions are executed by the EVM to change the blockchain's state. Writing the instructions in a smart contract properly is very important since the blockchain's state defines the most crucial information about your DApp, such as who has what amount of money.  

Since the instructions are difficult to write and make sense of at a low (assembly) level, we have smart contract languages such as Solidity to make it easier to write them. To help write, debug, test, and compile these smart contract languages, developers in the Ethereum community have created developer environments such as [Hardhat](/builders/build/eth-api/dev-env/hardhat){target=_blank} and [Foundry](/builders/build/eth-api/dev-env/foundry){target=_blank}. Moonbeam's developer site provides information on a [plethora of developer environments](/builders/build/eth-api/dev-env){target=_blank}.

This tutorial will use Hardhat for managing smart contracts.

### Create a Hardhat Project {: #create-hardhat-project }

You can initialize a project with Hardhat using the following command:  

```bash
npx hardhat init
```

When creating a JavaScript or TypeScript Hardhat project, you will be asked if you want to install the sample project's dependencies, which will install Hardhat and the [Hardhat Toolbox plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-toolbox#hardhat-toolbox){target=_blank}. You don't need all of the plugins that come wrapped up in the Toolbox, so instead you can install Hardhat, Ethers, and the Hardhat Ethers plugin, which is all you'll need for this tutorial:

```bash
npm install --save-dev  hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
```

Before we start writing the smart contract, let's add a JSON-RPC URL to the config. Set the `hardhat.config.js` file with the following code, and replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your funded account's private key.

!!! remember
    This is for testing purposes, **never store your private key in plain text with real funds**.  

```javascript
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');
module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.17',
  networks: {
    moonbase: {
      url: '{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}',
      chainId: {{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }},
      accounts: ['YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY']
    }
  }
};
```

!!! note
    With the release of [Solidity v0.8.20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20){target=_blank}, support for the Shanghai hard fork has been introduced, which includes `PUSH0` opcodes in the generated bytecode. Support for the `PUSH0` opcode on Moonbeam hasn't been rolled out yet. As such, if you'd like to use Solidity v0.8.20, you'll need to update the `solidity` config to use the London compiler:

    ```js
    solidity: {
      version: '0.8.20',
      settings: {
        evmVersion: 'london',
      },
    },
    ```

    If you attempt to use the default compiler of Solidity v0.8.20, you will see the following error:

    ```
    ProviderError: evm error: InvalidCode(Opcode(95))
    ```

### Write Smart Contracts {: #write-smart-contracts }

Recall that we're making a DApp that allows you to mint a token for a price. Let's write a smart contract that reflects this functionality!  

Once you've initialized a Hardhat project, you'll be able to write smart contracts in its `contracts` folder. This folder will have an initial smart contract, likely called `Lock.sol`, but you should delete it and add a new smart file called `MintableERC20.sol`.  

The standard for tokens is called ERC-20, where ERC stands for "*Ethereum Request for Comment*". A long time ago, this standard was defined, and now most smart contracts that work with tokens expect tokens to have all of the functionality defined by ERC-20. Fortunately, you don't have to know it from memory since the OpenZeppelin smart contract team provides us with smart contract bases to use.  

Install [OpenZeppelin smart contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/){target=_blank}:  

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

Now, in your `MintableERC20.sol`, add the following code:  

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MintableERC20 is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC20("Mintable ERC 20", "MERC") {}
}
```

When writing smart contracts, you're going to have to compile them eventually. Every developer environment for smart contracts will have this functionality. In Hardhat, you can compile with:  

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Everything should compile well, which should cause two new folders to pop up: `artifacts` and `cache`. These two folders hold information about the compiled smart contracts.  

Let's continue by adding functionality. Add the following constants, errors, event, and function to your Solidity file:  

```solidity
    uint256 public constant MAX_TO_MINT = 1000 ether;

    event PurchaseOccurred(address minter, uint256 amount);
    error MustMintOverZero();
    error MintRequestOverMax();
    error FailedToSendEtherToOwner();

    /**Purchases some of the token with native currency. */
    function purchaseMint() payable external {
        // Calculate amount to mint
        uint256 amountToMint = msg.value;

        // Check for no errors
        if(amountToMint == 0) revert MustMintOverZero();
        if(amountToMint + totalSupply() > MAX_TO_MINT) revert MintRequestOverMax();

        // Send to owner
        (bool success, ) = owner().call{value: msg.value}("");
        if(!success) revert FailedToSendEtherToOwner();

        // Mint to user
        _mint(msg.sender, amountToMint);
        emit PurchaseOccurred(msg.sender, amountToMint);
    }
```

??? code "MintableERC20.sol file"
    ```
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
    pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

    contract MintableERC20 is ERC20, Ownable {
        constructor() ERC20("Mintable ERC 20", "MERC") {}

        uint256 public constant MAX_TO_MINT = 1000 ether;

        event PurchaseOccurred(address minter, uint256 amount);
        error MustMintOverZero();
        error MintRequestOverMax();
        error FailedToSendEtherToOwner();

        /**Purchases some of the token with native gas currency. */
        function purchaseMint() external payable {
            // Calculate amount to mint
            uint256 amountToMint = msg.value;

            // Check for no errors
            if (amountToMint == 0) revert MustMintOverZero();
            if (amountToMint + totalSupply() > MAX_TO_MINT)
                revert MintRequestOverMax();

            // Send to owner
            (bool success, ) = owner().call{value: msg.value}("");
            if (!success) revert FailedToSendEtherToOwner();

            // Mint to user
            _mint(msg.sender, amountToMint);
            emit PurchaseOccurred(msg.sender, amountToMint);
        }
    }
    ```

This function will allow a user to send the native Moonbeam currency (like GLMR, MOVR, or DEV) as value because it is a payable function. Let's break down the function section by section.  

1. It will figure out how much of the token to mint based on the value sent
2. Then it will check to see if the amount minted is 0 or if the total amount minted is over the `MAX_TO_MINT`, giving a descriptive error in both cases
3. The contract will then forward the value included with the function call to the owner of the contract (by default, the address that deployed the contract, which will be you)
4. Finally, tokens will be minted to the user, and an event will be emitted to pick up on later  

To make sure that this works, let's use Hardhat again:  

```
npx hardhat compile
```

You've now written the smart contract for your DApp! If this were a production app, we would write tests for it, but that is out of the scope of this tutorial. Let's deploy it next.  

### Deploy Smart Contracts {: #deploying-smart-contracts }

Under the hood, Hardhat is a Node project that uses the [Ethers.js](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries/ethersjs){target=_blank} library to interact with the blockchain. You can also use Ethers.js in conjunction with Hardhat's tool to create scripts to do things like deploy contracts.  

Your Hardhat project should already come with a script in the `scripts` folder, called `deploy.js`. Let's replace it with a similar, albeit simpler, script.

```javascript
const hre = require('hardhat');

async function main() {
  const MintableERC20 = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('MintableERC20');
  const token = await MintableERC20.deploy();
  await token.deployed();

  console.log(`Deployed to ${token.address}`);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

This script uses Hardhat's instance of the Ethers library to get a contract factory of the `MintableERC20.sol` smart contract that we wrote earlier. It then deploys it and prints the resultant smart contract's address. Very simple to do with Hardhat and the Ethers.js library, but significantly more difficult using just JSON-RPC!  

Let's run the contract on Moonbase Alpha (whose JSON-RPC endpoint we defined in the `hardhat.config.js` script earlier):  

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network moonbase
```

You should see an output that displays the token address. Make sure to **save it for use later**! 

!!! challenge
    Hardhat has a poor built-in solution for deploying smart contracts. It doesn't automatically save the transactions and addresses related to the deployment! This is why the [hardhat-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy#1-hardhat-deploy){target=_blank} package was created. Can you implement it yourself? Or can you switch to a different developer environment, like [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry){target=_blank}?

## Create a DApp Frontend {: #creating-a-dapp-frontend }

Frontends provide an interface for users to interact with blockchain-based applications. React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is often used for developing DApp frontends due to its component-based architecture, which promotes reusable code and efficient rendering. The [useDApp package](https://usedapp.io/){target=_blank}, an Ethers.js based React framework for DApps, further simplifies the process of building DApp frontends by providing a comprehensive set of hooks and components that streamline the integration of Ethereum blockchain functionality.  

!!! note
    Typically, a larger project will create separate GitHub repositories for their frontend and smart contracts, but this is a small enough project to create a monorepo.

### Create a React Project with useDapp {: #create-react-project-with-usedapp }

Let's set up a new React project and install dependencies, which we can create within our Hardhat project's folder without much issue. The `create-react-app` package will create a new `frontend` directory for us:  

```bash
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
npm install ethers@5.6.9 @usedapp/core @mui/material @mui/system @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

If you remember, [Ethers.js](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=_blank} is a library that assists with JSON-RPC communication. The useDApp package is a similar library that uses Ethers.js and formats them into React hooks so that they work better in frontend projects. We've also added two [MUI](https://mui.com/){target=_blank} packages for styling and components.

Let's set up the `App.js` file located in the `frontend/src` directory to add some visual structure:

```javascript
import { useEthers } from '@usedapp/core';
import { Button, Grid, Card } from '@mui/material';
import { Box } from '@mui/system';

const styles = {
  box: { minHeight: '100vh', backgroundColor: '#1b3864' },
  vh100: { minHeight: '100vh' },
  card: { borderRadius: 4, padding: 4, maxWidth: '550px', width: '100%' },
  alignCenter: { textAlign: 'center' },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Box sx={styles.box}>
      <Grid
        container
        direction='column'
        alignItems='center'
        justifyContent='center'
        style={styles.vh100}
      >
        {/* This is where we'll be putting our functional components! */}
      </Grid>
    </Box>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You can start the React project by running the following command from within the `frontend` directory:

```
npm run start
```

!!! note
    At this point, you may see a couple compilation warnings, but as we continue to build the DApp, we'll make changes that will resolve the warnings.

Your frontend will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000){target=_blank}.

At this point, our frontend project is set up well enough to start working on the functional code!  

### Providers, Signers, and Wallets {: #providers-signers-and-wallets }

The frontend communicates with the blockchain using JSON-RPC, but we will be using Ethers.js. When using JSON-RPC, Ethers.js likes to abstract degrees of interaction with the blockchain into objects, such as providers, signers, and wallets.  

Providers are the bridge between the frontend user interface and the blockchain network, facilitating communication and data exchange. They abstract the complexities of interacting with the blockchain, offering a simple API for the frontend to use. They are responsible for connecting the DApp to a specific blockchain node, allowing it to read data from the blockchain, and essentially contain the JSON-RPC URL.  

Signers are a type of provider that contain a secret that can be used to sign transactions with. This allows the frontend to create transactions, sign them, and then send them with `eth_sendRawTransaction`. There are multiple types of signers, but we're most interested in wallet objects, which securely store and manage users' private keys and digital assets. Wallets such as MetaMask facilitate transaction signing with a universal and user-friendly process. They act as a user's representation within the DApp, ensuring that only authorized transactions are executed. The Ethers.js wallet object represents this interface within our frontend code.

Typically, a frontend using Ethers.js will require you to create a provider, connect to the user's wallet if applicable, and create a wallet object. This process can become unwieldy in larger projects, especially with the number of wallets that exist other than MetaMask.  

??? code "Example of unwieldy MetaMask handling"

    ```javascript
    // Detect if the browser has MetaMask installed
    let provider, signer;
    if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
      // Create a provider using MetaMask
      provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);

      // Connect to MetaMask
      async function connectToMetaMask() {
        try {
          // Request access to the user's MetaMask account
          const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
            method: 'eth_requestAccounts',
          });

          // Create a signer (wallet) using the provider
          signer = provider.getSigner(accounts[0]);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error connecting to MetaMask:', error);
        }
      }

      // Call the function to connect to MetaMask
      connectToMetaMask();
    } else {
      console.log('MetaMask is not installed');
    }

    // ... also the code for disconnecting from the site
    // ... also the code that handles other wallets
    ```

Fortunately, we have installed the useDApp package, which simplifies many of the processes for us. This simultaneously abstracts what Ethers is doing as well, which is why we took a bit of time to explain them here.  

#### Create a Provider {: #create-provider }

Let's do a bit of setup with the useDApp package. First, in your React frontend's `index.js` file, which is located in the `frontend/src` directory, add a `DAppProvider` object and its config. This essentially acts as the Ethers.js provider object, but can be used throughout your entire project by useDApp hooks:  

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import { DAppProvider, MoonbaseAlpha } from '@usedapp/core';
import { getDefaultProvider } from 'ethers';

const config = {
  readOnlyChainId: MoonbaseAlpha.chainId,
  readOnlyUrls: {
    [MoonbaseAlpha.chainId]: getDefaultProvider(
      '{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}'
    ),
  },
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <DAppProvider config={config}>
      <App />
    </DAppProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

#### Connect to a Wallet {: #connect-to-a-wallet }

Now in your `App.js` file, let's add a button that allows us to connect to MetaMask. We don't have to write any code that's wallet-specific, fortunately, since useDApp does it for us with the `useEthers` hook.  

```javascript
function App() {
  const { activateBrowserWallet, deactivate, account } = useEthers();

  // Handle the wallet toggle
  const handleWalletConnection = () => {
    if (account) deactivate();
    else activateBrowserWallet();
  };

  return (
    <Box sx={styles.box}>
      <Grid
        container
        direction='column'
        alignItems='center'
        justifyContent='center'
        style={styles.vh100}
      >
        <Box position='absolute' top={8} right={16}>
          <Button variant='contained' onClick={handleWalletConnection}>
            {account
              ? `Disconnect ${account.substring(0, 5)}...`
              : 'Connect Wallet'}
          </Button>
        </Box>
      </Grid>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

Now there should be a button in the top right of your screen that connects your wallet to your frontend! Next, let's find out how we can read data from our smart contract.  

### Read Data from Smart Contracts {: #reading-from-contracts }

Reading from contracts is quite easy, as long as we know what we want to read. For our application, we will be reading the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted and the number of tokens that have already been minted. This way, we can display to our users how many tokens can still be minted and hopefully invoke some FOMO...  

If you were just using JSON-RPC, you would use `eth_call` to get this data, but it's quite difficult to do this since you have to [encode your requests](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html){target=_blank} in a non-straightforward method called ABI encoding. Fortunately, Ethers.js allows us to easily create objects that represent contracts in a human-readable way, so long as we have the ABI of the contract. And we have the ABI of the `MintableERC20.sol` contract, `MintableERC20.json`, within the `artifacts` directory of our Hardhat project!

So let's start by moving the `MintableERC20.json` file into our frontend directory. Every time you change and recompile the smart contract, you'll have to update the ABI in the frontend as well. Some projects will have developer setups that automatically pull ABIs from the same source, but in this case we will just copy it over:  

```JSON
|--artifacts
    |--@openzeppelin
    |--build-info
    |--contracts
        |--MintableERC20.sol
            |--MintableERC20.json // This is the file you're looking for!
            ...
|--cache
|--contracts
|--frontend
    |--public
    |--src
        |--MintableERC20.json // Copy the file to here!
        ...
    ...
...
```

Now that we have the ABI, we can use it to create a contract instance of `MintableERC20.sol`, which we'll use to retrieve token data.

#### Create a Smart Contract Instance {: #create-a-contract-instance }

Let's import the JSON file and the Ethers `Contract` object within `App.js`. We can create a contract object instance with an address and ABI, so replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE` with the address of the contract that you copied [back when you deployed it](#deploying-smart-contracts):

```javascript
// ... other imports
import MintableERC20 from './MintableERC20.json'; 
import { Contract } from 'ethers';

const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';

function App() {
  const contract = new Contract(contractAddress, MintableERC20.abi);
  // ...
}
```

??? code "App.js file"

    ```js
    import { useEthers } from '@usedapp/core';
    import { Button, Grid, Card } from '@mui/material';
    import { Box } from '@mui/system';
    import { Contract } from 'ethers';
    import MintableERC20 from './MintableERC20.json'; 

    const styles = {
      box: { minHeight: '100vh', backgroundColor: '#1b3864' },

      // Handle the wallet toggle
      const handleWalletConnection = () => {

              </Button>
            </Box>

      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

#### Interact with the Contract Interface to Read Supply Data {: #interact-with-contract-interface }

And let's create a new `SupplyComponent` within a new `SupplyComponent.js` file, which will use the contract interface to retrieve the token supply data and display it:  

```javascript
import { useCall } from '@usedapp/core';
import { utils } from 'ethers';
import { Grid } from '@mui/material';

export default function SupplyComponent({ contract }) {
  const totalSupply = useCall({ contract, method: 'totalSupply', args: [] });
  const maxSupply = useCall({ contract, method: 'MAX_TO_MINT', args: [] });
  const totalSupplyFormatted = totalSupply
    ? utils.formatEther(totalSupply.value.toString())
    : '...';
  const maxSupplyFormatted = maxSupply
    ? utils.formatEther(maxSupply.value.toString())
    : '...';

  const centeredText = { textAlign: 'center' };

  return (
    <Grid item xs={12}>
      <h3 style={centeredText}>
        Total Supply: {totalSupplyFormatted} / {maxSupplyFormatted}
      </h3>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

Notice that this component uses the `useCall` hook provided by the useDApp package. This call takes in the contract object we created earlier, a string method, and any relevant arguments for the read-only call and returns the output. While it required some setup, this one-liner is a lot simpler than the entire `use_call` RPC call that we would have had to do if we weren't using Ethers.js and useDApp.  

Also note that we're using a utility format called `formatEther` to format the output values instead of displaying them directly. This is because our token, like gas currencies, is stored as an unsigned integer with a fixed decimal point of 18 figures. The utility function helps format this value into a way that we, as humans, expect.  

Now we can spice up our frontend and call the read-only functions in the contract. We'll update the frontend so that we have a place to display our supply data:

```javascript
// ... other imports
import SupplyComponent from './SupplyComponent';

function App() {
  // ...

  return (
    {/* Wrapper Components */}
      {/* Button Component */}
      <Card sx={styles.card}>
        <h1 style={styles.alignCenter}>Mint Your Token!</h1>
        <SupplyComponent contract={contract} />
      </Card>
    {/* Wrapper Components */}
  )
}
```

??? code "App.js file"

    ```javascript
    import { useEthers } from '@usedapp/core';
    import { Button, Grid, Card } from '@mui/material';
    import { Box } from '@mui/system';
    import { Contract } from 'ethers';
    import MintableERC20 from './MintableERC20.json'; 
    import SupplyComponent from './SupplyComponent';

    const styles = {
      box: { minHeight: '100vh', backgroundColor: '#1b3864' },
      vh100: { minHeight: '100vh' },
      card: { borderRadius: 4, padding: 4, maxWidth: '550px', width: '100%' },
      alignCenter: { textAlign: 'center' },
    };
    const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';

    function App() {
      const { activateBrowserWallet, deactivate, account } = useEthers();
      const contract = new Contract(contractAddress, MintableERC20.abi);

      // Handle the wallet toggle
      const handleWalletConnection = () => {
        if (account) deactivate();
        else activateBrowserWallet();
      };

      return (
        <Box sx={styles.box}>
          <Grid
            container
            direction='column'
            alignItems='center'
            justifyContent='center'
            style={styles.vh100}
          >
            <Box position='absolute' top={8} right={16}>
              <Button variant='contained' onClick={handleWalletConnection}>
                {account
                  ? `Disconnect ${account.substring(0, 5)}...`
                  : 'Connect Wallet'}
              </Button>
            </Box>
            <Card sx={styles.card}>
              <h1 style={styles.alignCenter}>Mint Your Token!</h1>
              <SupplyComponent contract={contract} />
            </Card>
          </Grid>
        </Box>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

Our frontend should now display the correct data!  

![Displaying data](/images/tutorials/eth-api/how-to-build-a-dapp/how-to-build-a-dapp-3.png)

!!! challenge
    There's additonal information that could be helpful to display, such as the amount of tokens that the connected account currently has: `balanceOf(address)`. Can you add that to the frontend yourself?

### Send Transactions {: #sending-transactions }

Now for the most important part of all DApps: the state-changing transactions. This is where money moves, where tokens are minted, and value passes.  

If you recall from our smart contract, we want to mint some tokens by calling the `purchaseMint` function with some native currency. So we're going to need:  

1. A text input that lets the user specify how much value to enter  
2. A button that lets the user initiate the transaction signature

Let's create a new component called `MintingComponent` in a new file called `MintingComponent.js`. First, we'll tackle the text input, which will require us to add the logic to store the number of tokens to mint and a text field element.


```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useContractFunction, useEthers } from '@usedapp/core';
import { Button, CircularProgress, TextField, Grid } from '@mui/material';
import { utils } from 'ethers';

export default function MintingComponent({ contract }) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  const textFieldStyle = { marginBottom: '16px' };

  return (
    <>
      <Grid item xs={12}>
        <TextField 
          type='number'
          onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
          label='Enter value in DEV'
          variant='outlined'
          fullWidth
          style={textFieldStyle} 
        />
      </Grid>
      {/* This is where we'll add the button */}
    </>
  );
}
```

Next, we'll need to create the button to send the transaction, which will call the `purchaseMint` of our contract. Interacting with the contract will be a bit more difficult since you're likely not as familiar with it. We've already done a lot of setup in the previous sections, so it doesn't actually take too much code:  

```javascript
export default function MintingComponent({ contract }) {
  // ...

  // Mint transaction
  const { account } = useEthers();
  const { state, send } = useContractFunction(contract, 'purchaseMint');
  const handlePurchaseMint = async () => {
    if (chainId !== MoonbaseAlpha.chainId) {
      await switchNetwork(MoonbaseAlpha.chainId);
    }
    send({ value: utils.parseEther(value.toString()) });
  };
  const isMining = state?.status === 'Mining';

  return (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      <Grid item xs={12}>
        <Button
          variant='contained' color='primary' fullWidth
          onClick={handlePurchaseMint}
          disabled={state.status === 'Mining' || account == null}
        >
          {isMining? <CircularProgress size={24} /> : 'Purchase Mint'}
        </Button>
      </Grid>
    </>
  );
}
```

??? code "MintingComponent.js file"

    ```js
    import { useState } from 'react';
    import { useContractFunction, useEthers } from '@usedapp/core';
    import { Button, CircularProgress, TextField, Grid } from '@mui/material';
    import { utils } from 'ethers';

    export default function MintingComponent({ contract }) {
      const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
      const textFieldStyle = { marginBottom: '16px' };

      const { account } = useEthers();
      const { state, send } = useContractFunction(contract, 'purchaseMint');
      const handlePurchaseMint = async () => {
        if (chainId !== MoonbaseAlpha.chainId) {
          await switchNetwork(MoonbaseAlpha.chainId);
        }
        send({ value: utils.parseEther(value.toString()) });
      };
      const isMining = state?.status === 'Mining';

      return (
        <>
          <Grid item xs={12}>
            <TextField 
              type='number'
              onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
              label='Enter value in DEV'
              variant='outlined'
              fullWidth
              style={textFieldStyle} 
            />
          </Grid>
          <Grid item xs={12}>
            <Button
              variant='contained' color='primary' fullWidth
              onClick={handlePurchaseMint}
              disabled={state.status === 'Mining' || account == null}
            >
              {isMining? <CircularProgress size={24} /> : 'Purchase Mint'}
            </Button>
          </Grid>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

Let's break down the non-JSX code a bit:  

1. The user's account information is being retrieved via `useEthers`, which can be done because useDApp provides this information throughout the entire project
2. The `useContractFunction` hook from useDApp is used to create a function, `send`, that will sign and send a transaction that calls the `purchaseMint` function on the contract defined by the `contract` object
3. Another function, `handlePurchaseMint`, is defined to help inject the native gas value defined by the `TextField` component into the `send` function. It first checks if the user has their wallet connected to Moonbase Alpha, and if not, it prompts the user to switch networks
4. A helper constant will determine whether or not the transaction is still in the `Mining` phase, that is, it hasn't finished

Now let's look at the visual component. The button will call the `handlePurchaseMint` on press, which makes sense. The button will also be disabled while the transaction happens and if the user hasn't connected to the DApp with their wallet (when the account value isn't defined).  

This code essentially boils down to using the `useContractFunction` hook in conjunction with the `contract` object, which is a lot simpler than what it does under the hood! Let's add this component to the main `App.js` file.  

```javascript
// ... other imports
import MintingComponent from './MintingComponent';

function App() {
  // ...

  return (
    {/* Wrapper Components */}
      {/* Button Component */}
      <Card sx={styles.card}>
        <h1 style={styles.alignCenter}>Mint Your Token!</h1>
        <SupplyComponent contract={contract} />
        <MintingComponent contract={contract} />
      </Card>
    {/* Wrapper Components */}
  )
}
```

    import MintableERC20 from './MintableERC20.json'; 
    import SupplyComponent from './SupplyComponent';
    import MintingComponent from './MintingComponent';

    const styles = {

      const contract = new Contract(contractAddress, MintableERC20.abi);

      // Handle the wallet toggle
      const handleWalletConnection = () => {

        else activateBrowserWallet();
      };

### Read Events from Contracts {: #reading-events-from-contracts }

A common way of listening to what happened in a transaction is through events, also known as logs. These logs are emitted by the smart contract through the `emit` and `event` keywords and can be very important in a responsive frontend. Often, DApps will use toast elements to represent events in real-time, but for this DApp, we will use a simple table.  

We created an event in our smart contract: `event PurchaseOccurred(address minter, uint256 amount)`, so let's figure out how to display its information in the frontend.  

Let's create a new component `PurchaseOccurredEvents` within a new file `PurchaseOccurredEvents.js` that reads the last five logs and displays them in a table:  

```javascript
import { useLogs, useBlockNumber } from '@usedapp/core';
import { utils } from 'ethers';
import {
  Grid,
  Table,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
  TableContainer,
  TableHead,
  TableRow,
} from '@mui/material';

export default function PurchaseOccurredEvents({ contract }) {
  return (
    <Grid item xs={12} marginTop={5}>
      <TableContainer >
        <Table>
          <TableHead>
            <TableRow>
              <TableCell>Minter</TableCell>
              <TableCell align='right'>Amount</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
          </TableHead>
          <TableBody>
            {/* This is where we have to inject data from our logs! */}
          </TableBody>
        </Table>
      </TableContainer>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

This component so far creates an empty table, so let's use two new hooks to read those logs:  

```javascript
export default function PurchaseOccurredEvents({ contract }) {
  // Get block number to ensure that the useLogs doesn't search from 0, otherwise it will time out
  const blockNumber = useBlockNumber();

  // Create a filter & get the logs
  const filter = { args: [null, null], contract, event: 'PurchaseOccurred' };
  const logs = useLogs(filter, { fromBlock: blockNumber - 10000 });
  const parsedLogs = logs?.value.slice(-5).map(log => log.data);

  // ... 
}
```

Here's what happens in this code:  

1. The block number is received from the `useBlockNumber` hook, similar to using the JSON-RPC method `eth_blockNumber`
2. A filter is created to filter for all events with any arguments on the contract injected into the component with the event name `PurchaseOccurred`
3. Logs are queried for via the `useLogs` hook, similar to using the `eth_getLogs` JSON-RPC method. Note that we're only querying the last 10,000 blocks because otherwise the entire history of the blockchain would be queried and the RPC would timeout
4. The resultant logs are parsed, and the most recent five are selected

If we want to display them, we can do it like so:  

```javascript
export default function PurchaseOccurredEvents({ contract }) {
  // ...
  return (
    <Grid item xs={12} marginTop={5}>
      <TableContainer >
        <Table>
          {/* TableHead Component */}
          <TableBody>
            {parsedLogs?.reverse().map((log, index) => (
              <TableRow key={index}>
                <TableCell>{log.minter}</TableCell>
                <TableCell align='right'>
                  {utils.formatEther(log.amount)} tokens
                </TableCell>
              </TableRow>
            ))}
          </TableBody>
        </Table>
      </TableContainer>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

??? code "PurchaseOccurredEvents.js file"

    ```js
    import { useLogs, useBlockNumber } from '@usedapp/core';
    import { utils } from 'ethers';
    import {
      Grid,
      Table,
      TableBody,
      TableCell,
      TableContainer,
      TableHead,
      TableRow,
    } from '@mui/material';

    export default function PurchaseOccurredEvents({ contract }) {
      // Get block number to ensure that the useLogs doesn't search from 0, otherwise it will time out
      const blockNumber = useBlockNumber();

      // Create a filter & get the logs
      const filter = { args: [null, null], contract, event: 'PurchaseOccurred' };
      const logs = useLogs(filter, { fromBlock: blockNumber - 10000 });
      const parsedLogs = logs?.value.slice(-5).map((log) => log.data);
      return (
        <Grid item xs={12} marginTop={5}>
          <TableContainer>
            <Table>
              <TableHead>
                <TableRow>
                  <TableCell>Minter</TableCell>
                  <TableCell align='right'>Amount</TableCell>
                </TableRow>
              </TableHead>
              <TableBody>
                {parsedLogs?.reverse().map((log, index) => (
                  <TableRow key={index}>
                    <TableCell>{log.minter}</TableCell>
                    <TableCell align='right'>
                      {utils.formatEther(log.amount)} tokens
                    </TableCell>
                  </TableRow>
                ))}
              </TableBody>
            </Table>
          </TableContainer>
        </Grid>
      );
    }
    ```

This too should be added to `App.js`.

  // ...

    {/* Wrapper Components */}
      {/* Button Component */}

    export default App;
    ```

And, if you've done any transactions, you'll see that they'll pop up!

Now you've implemented three main components of DApp frontends: reading from storage, sending transactions, and reading logs. With these building blocks as well as the knowledge you gained with smart contracts and nodes, you should be able to cover 80% of DApps.

## Conclusion {: #conclusion }

In this tutorial, we covered a wide range of topics and tools essential for successful DApp development. We started with Hardhat, a powerful development environment that simplifies the process of writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Ethers.js, a popular library for interacting with Ethereum nodes, was introduced to manage wallets and transactions.  

We delved into the process of writing smart contracts, highlighting best practices and key considerations when developing on-chain logic. The guide then explored useDApp, a React-based framework, for creating a user-friendly frontend. We discussed techniques for reading data from contracts, executing transactions, and working with logs to ensure a seamless user experience.

Of course, there are more advanced (but optional) components of DApps that have popped up over time:

- Decentralized storage protocols — systems that store websites and files in a decentralized way
- [Oracles](/builders/integrations/oracles/){target=_blank} — third-party services that provide external data to smart contracts within blockchains
- [Indexing protocols](/builders/integrations/indexers/){target=_blank} — middleware that processes and organizes blockchain data, allowing it to be efficiently queried

An excellent [Web2 to Web3 blogpost](https://moonbeam.network/blog/web2-vs-web3-development-heres-what-you-need-to-know-to-make-the-leap-to-blockchain/){target=_blank} is available if you are interested in hearing about them in depth.  

Hopefully, by reading this guide, you'll be well on your way to creating novel DApps on Moonbeam!
