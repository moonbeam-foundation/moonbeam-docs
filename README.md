# Welcome to Moonbeam
Test Test
![Main Page Banner](/images/main-banner.png)

This site provides documentation for Moonbeam, a smart contract parachain on the Polkadot network that is fully Ethereum Compatible.  Here, you'll find both high-level and technical information for developers, collators, end-users, and other Moonbeam network participants.

This site will grow and be refined over time as Moonbeam is developed.  We welcome you to join the Moonbeam community and contribute to this site and to the project.

## What is Moonbeam? 

Moonbeam is a developer-oriented blockchain that strives to provide compatibility with the existing Ethereum developer toolchain and network.  It does this by providing a full EVM implementation, a Web3-compatible API, and bridges that connect Moonbeam to existing Ethereum networks.  This allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes.

Moonbeam will also be a parachain on the Polkadot network. That means it will get shared security from the Polkadot relay chain and will be able to integrate with other chains that are connected to Polkadot (once that functionality is available on Polkadot).

## How to Get Started with Moonbeam

### Networks

Currently, there are two ways you can start building on Moonbeam: 

 - Build your own Moonbeam instance as a [standalone node](/getting-started/local-node/setting-up-a-node/)
 - [Connect](/getting-started/testnet/connect/) to the [Moonbase Alpha TestNet](/networks/testnet/)

### Wallets

Currently, we have tested Moonbeam with the following wallets:

 - [MetaMask](/integrations/wallets/metamask/)
 - [MathWallet](/integrations/wallets/mathwallet/)

However, any wallet that works with an Ethereum custom network should work with Moonbeam as well!

### Tools

Because of Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility features, you can use the development tools you know and love:

 - [Remix](/integrations/remix/)
 - [Truffle](/integrations/trufflebox/)
 - [HardHat](/integrations/hardhat/)
 - [Web3.js](/integrations/ethlibraries/web3js/)
 - [Ethers.js](/integrations/ethlibraries/etherjs/)
 - [Web3.py](/integrations/ethlibraries/web3py/)

### Oracles

 We also have a number of Oracles that can serve as data feed to your smart contracts:

 - [Chainlink](/integrations/oracles/chainlink/)
 - [Band Protocol](/integrations/oracles/band-protocol/)
 - [Razor Network](/integrations/oracles/razor-network/)

### Bridges

Currently, we have a fully functioning bridge implementation that connects Ethereum's Rinkeby/Kovan TestNets and Moonbase Alpha:

 - [ChainBridge](/integrations/bridges/ethereum/chainbridge/)
