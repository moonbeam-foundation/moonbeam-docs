# Verify Smart Contracts with Etherscan Plugins

![Explorer Banner](/images/builders/tools/explorers/etherscan-plugins/plugins-banner.png)

## Introduction {: #introduction } 

Verifying smart contracts is a great way of improving the transparency and security of contracts deployed on Moonbeam. There are a couple of plugins that integrate with Etherscan's contract verification service, including the [`hardhat-etherscan` plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan.html){target=blank} and the [`truffle-plugin-verify` plugin](https://github.com/rkalis/truffle-plugin-verify){target=blank}. Both plugins can be used to automate the process of verifying contracts.

The Hardhat plugin integrates seamlessly into your Hardhat project, and likewise the Truffle plugin integrates into your Truffle project.

This guide will show you how to use both plugins to verify smart contracts deployed on Moonbase Alpha.

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have:

- [MetaMask installed and connected to the Moonbase Alpha](/tokens/connect/metamask/) TestNet
- An account funded with `DEV` tokens. You can obtain tokens for testing purposes from the Moonbase Alpha [faucet](/builders/get-started/moonbase/#get-tokens/)
