 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=Moonbeam){target=\_blank}
 - **Substrate API** — [Subscan](https://moonbeam.subscan.io){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}

## Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to Moonbeam:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbeam">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Moonbeam as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Moonbeam.
