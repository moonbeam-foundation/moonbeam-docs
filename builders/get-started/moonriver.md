## Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to Moonriver:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonriver">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Moonriver as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Moonriver.

If you do not have MetaMask installed, or would like to follow a tutorial to get started, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/) guide.

If you want to connect MetaMask by providing the network information, you can use the following data:

 - Network Name: `Moonriver`
 - RPC URL: `{{ networks.moonriver.rpc_url }}`
 - ChainID: `{{ networks.moonriver.chain_id }}` (hex: `{{ networks.moonriver.hex_chain_id }}`)
 - Symbol (Optional): `MOVR`
 - Block Explorer (Optional): `{{ networks.moonriver.block_explorer }}`
