## Public Endpoints {: #public-endpoints }

Moonbeam-based networks have two endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

The endpoints in this section are for development purposes only and are not meant to be used in production applications.

If you are looking for an API provider suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](#endpoint-providers) section of this guide.

### Moonbeam {: #moonbeam }

--8<-- 'text/endpoints/moonbeam.md'

### Moonriver {: #moonriver }

--8<-- 'text/endpoints/moonriver.md'

### Moonbase Alpha {: #moonbase-alpha }

--8<-- 'text/endpoints/moonbase.md'

## RPC Endpoint Providers {: #endpoint-providers }

You can create your own endpoint suitable for development or production use using any of the following API providers:

- [1RPC](#1rpc)
- [Blast](#blast)
- [BlockSpaces](#blockspaces)
- [Dwellir](#dwellir)
- [GetBlock](#getblock)
- [OnFinality](#onfinality)
- [Pocket Network](#pokt)
- [UnitedBloc](#unitedbloc)
<!-- - [Ankr](#ankr) -->

### 1RPC {: #1rpc}

[1RPC](https://1rpc.io/){target=_blank} is a free and private RPC relay that protects user privacy by preventing data collection, user tracking, phishing attempts from other parties. It tunnels user requests via distributed relays to other RPC providers whilst preventing the tracking of user metadata such as IP address, device information and wallet linkability with secure enclave technology.

1RPC is created to be an open initiative from the blockchain infrastructure community. They are motivated by a common good mission to help build a better Web3 and encourage anyone who values user privacy to join this open collaboration.

Head over to [1RPC](https://1rpc.io/){target=_blank} official site to set it up!

## Tracing RPC Endpoint Providers {: #tracing-providers }

Tracing RPC endpoints allow you to access non-standard RPC methods, such as those that belong to Geth's `debug` and `txpool` APIs and OpenEthereum's `trace` module. To see a list of the supported non-standard RPC methods on Moonbeam for debugging and tracing, please refer to the [Debug API & Trace Module](/builders/build/eth-api/debug-trace){target=_blank} guide.

The following providers provide tracing RPC endpoints:

- [OnFinality](#onfinality-tracing)

### OnFinality {: #onfinality-tracing }

[OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/){target=_blank}'s Trace API can be used to quickly get started tracing and debugging transactions on Moonbeam and Moonriver. It is only available to users on their [Growth and Ultimate plans](https://onfinality.io/pricing){target=_blank}.

To use the Trace API, you simply call the trace method of your choice from your [private RPC endpoint](#onfinality). For a list of the supported networks and trace methods, please check out [OnFinality's Trace API documentation](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/trace-api#TraceAPI-SupportedNetworks){target=_blank}.

Please note that if you are tracing historic blocks, it is recommended to use your own dedicated trace node to backfill any data, and then once you're caught up, you can switch to using the Trace API. You can check out the [How to Deploy a Trace Node for Moonbeam on OnFinality](https://onfinality.medium.com/how-to-deploy-a-trace-node-for-moonbeam-on-onfinality-85683181d290){target=-_blank} post for more information on how to spin up your own dedicated trace node.
