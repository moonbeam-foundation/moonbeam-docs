 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/){target=_blank}
 - **Ethereum API with Indexing** — [Blockscout](https://moonbase-blockscout.testnet.moonbeam.network/){target=_blank}

For more information on each of the available block explorers, please head to the [Block Explorers](/builders/tools/explorers) section of the documentation.

## Connect MetaMask

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbase">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Moonbase Alpha.

If you do not have MetaMask installed, or would like to follow a tutorial to get started, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/) guide.

If you want to connect MetaMask by providing the network information, you can use the following data:

 - Network Name: `Moonbase Alpha`
 - RPC URL: `{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}`
 - ChainID: `{{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }}` (hex: `{{ networks.moonbase.hex_chain_id }}`)
 - Symbol (Optional): `DEV`
 - Block Explorer (Optional): `{{ networks.moonbase.block_explorer }}`

## Get Tokens {: #get-tokens } 

To start building on Moonbase Alpha, you can get DEV tokens from our [faucet](https://discord.gg/PfpUATX), in our Discord Channel. For specific amounts, you can always reach out directly to us via our community channels.

### Discord - Mission Control {: #discord-mission-control } 

To request tokens automatically, we've created a Discord bot (named Mission Control :sunglasses:) that will automatically send a maximum of 5 DEV tokens every 24 hours (per Discord user) when you enter your address. You can check it out on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/PfpUATX).
 
Under the category "Miscellaneous," you will find our #Moonbase-Faucet channel.

To check your balance, enter the following message, replacing `<enter-address-here->` with your H160 address:

```
!balance <enter-address-here->
```

To get DEV tokens, enter the following message, replacing `<enter-address-here->` with your H160 address:
 
```
!faucet send <enter-address-here->
```

Mission Control will send you 5 DEV tokens and display your current account balance. Remember that Mission Control is limited to dispense once every 24 hours per Discord user.

!!! note
    Moonbase Alpha DEV tokens have no value. Please don't spam the faucet with unnecessary requests.
