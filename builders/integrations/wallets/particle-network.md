# Particle Network Wallet Abstraction

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Particle Network](https://particle.network){target=\_blank} offers Wallet Abstraction services with an Account Abstraction stack, providing a suite of SDKs focused on reducing user onboarding friction. 

By embedding customizable Externally Owned Account (EOA) and [Account Abstraction (AA)](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction){target=\_blank} components, Particle allows quick 2-click onboarding via social logins like Google, email, and phone, as well as traditional Web3 methods. This approach removes the need for users to manage a conventional wallet, delivering a streamlined, application-specific experience for Web3 interactions.

Particle Network supports Moonbeam, Moonriver, and the Moonbase Alpha TestNet with both standard EOA interactions and native [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337){target=\_blank} `SimpleAccount` implementations, providing full-stack account abstraction.

Key components of Particle Network's Moonbeam integration include:

- **Particle Connect**: Particle's flagship Wallet-as-a-Service solution, offering embedded wallets powered by MPC-TSS for smooth, Web2-like onboarding and interactions, with Account Abstraction support integrated within a single SDK
- **Particle Network Modular [AA Stack](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction){target=\_blank}**: Beyond the default EOA-based interactions, Particle also offers a modular AA stack for ERC-4337 account abstraction on Moonbeam, allowing flexibility in the smart account, bundler, and paymaster configurations to suit AA-enabled applications

In this guide, you'll go through a step-by-step example of using Particle Connect on Moonbeam.

## Create an Application {: #create-an-application }

To use Particle Connect on Moonbeam, you'll need to create an account on the [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network){target=\_blank} and spin up an application

1. Navigate to the Particle Network dashboard, then sign up or log in

    ![Dashboard login](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/particle-2.webp)

2. Once logged in, click **Add New Project** to create a new project

    ![Project creation](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/particle-3.webp)

3. Enter the project name and click **Save**

4. From the project's dashboard, scroll down to the **Your Apps** section and create a new app by selecting **iOS**, **Android**, or **Web** and providing the requested information

## Install Dependencies {: #install-dependencies }

To integrate Particle Connect into your Moonbeam application, you'll need only a few dependencies. Particle Connect offers built-in Account Abstraction (AA) support; however, in this example, we'll install the Particle AA SDK to utilize EIP-1193 providers, such as ethers.


```bash
yarn add @particle-network/connectkit viem@^2 @particle-network/aa ethers
```

> Note that this tutorial is based on a [Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank} with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Configure Particle Connect {: #configure-particle-network }

We’ll configure and initialize Particle Connect (Particle's flagship authentication SDK). Begin by creating a new file called `ConnectKit.tsx` in your project’s root directory, where we’ll set up the `ParticleConnectKit` component as the primary interface for configuration.

Before proceeding, head back to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network){target=\_blank} and retrieve the following API keys:

- **`projectId`** – your project’s unique ID
- **`clientKey`** – your client-specific key
- **`appId`** – your application ID

These keys are essential as they connect your Particle Connect instance with the Particle dashboard, enabling features like no-code customization, user activity tracking, and API request authentication.

Place the API keys in a `.env` file in the following format:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='INSERT_PROJECT_ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY='INSERT_CLIENT_KEY'
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID='INSERT_APP_ID'
```

This setup ensures that your API keys are securely accessible to the Next.js application while protecting them from unauthorized access.

Here’s the code to add to your `ConnectKit.tsx` file:

```js
--8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/configure-particle.js'
```

This setup initializes `ParticleConnectKit`, a wrapper for the configured `ConnectKitProvider` instance, using your project keys. It also defines essential SDK settings, such as supported chains (e.g., Moonbeam), wallet positioning and visibility options, and a `SIMPLE` smart account instance.

For further customization options, refer to the [Particle Connect documentation](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/connect/desktop/web#configuration){target=\_blank}.

At this point, you've signed up and created an application, installed all required dependencies, and configured `ParticleConnectKit` and `SmartAccount,` if applicable.

## Integrate the `ParticleConnectKit` Component in Your App {: #integrate-particleconnectkit }

After completing the configuration, wrap your application with the `ParticleConnectKit` component to enable global access to the Particle Connect SDK. Update your `layout.tsx` file in `src` as shown below:

```js
--8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/layout-code.js'
```

Wrapping your application in `ParticleConnectKit` provides global access to the SDK, making features like social logins and wallet generation available throughout your app. This setup in `layout.tsx` ensures all components can access Particle Connect’s capabilities.

### Connecting Wallet

With the configured `layout.tsx` file, the next step is to add a central **Connect Wallet** button for user connectivity. You can achieve this by importing `ConnectButton` from `@particle-network/connectkit`. Once the user logs in, the `ConnectButton` transforms into an embedded widget.

```js
--8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/connect.js'
```

### Sending transactions with an EIP-1193 provider

Using Particle Connect alongside the Particle AA SDK enables you to work with an EIP-1193 provider like ethers. This approach is beneficial because you're likely already familiar with these providers or if you integrate Particle Connect into an existing application.

To set this up, wrap the smart account provided by Particle Connect with an instance of ethers to create a `customProvider.` You can use ethers as usual from there, with the smart account as the underlying transaction signer.

```js
--8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/ethers-tx.js'
```

## Example of Utilization {: #example-of-utilization }

With those above established, Particle Connect can be used similarly, as shown in the example application below.

Specifically, this application creates a smart account on Moonbeam MainNet through social login, then uses it to send a gasless transaction of 0.001 GLMR with the ethers provider.

```js
--8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/example-app.js'
```

That concludes the brief introduction to Particle's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service stack and how to get started with Particle on Moonbeam. For more information, you can check out [Particle Network's documentation](https://docs.particle.network){target=\_blank}.
