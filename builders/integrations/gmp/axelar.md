# Axelar Network

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Axelar](https://axelar.network/){target=_blank} delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3. Axelar's infrastructure enables dApp users to interact with any asset or application, on any connected chain, with one click. Powered by a permissionless Proof-of-Stake validator set, Axelar network allows dApps to pass arbitrary messages across chains using Turing-complete calls.

Axelar is a full-stack transport layer that supports asset transfer, [General Message Passing](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/gmp-overview){target=_blank} and composability of programs. It securely connects all blockchain ecosystems, applications, assets and users to deliver Web3 interoperability. Axelar is composed of a decentralized network of validators, secure gateway contracts, uniform translation, routing architecture, and a suite of protocols and application programming interfaces (APIs). Take a look at the [Tech Stack Diagram](https://axelar.network/blog/an-introduction-to-the-axelar-network){target=_blank} for more details.

The Axelar APIs provide a rich suite for developing Web3 applications, ensuring that developers have the tools they need for building. With these tools and APIs, developers can use the Axelar network and its APIs to write dApps that can be easily deployed across all Axelar-connected ecosystems. In other words, Axelar distills cross-chain interoperability down to a simple set of API requests.

## Getting Started {: #getting-started }

There are a couple of resources to get you started building cross-chain applications with Axelar:

- **[Developer documentation](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/intro){target=_blank}** - for technical guides
- **[Satellite](https://satellite.money/){target=_blank}** - a bridging UI used to transfer assets across chains

There is also a block explorer available to track your cross-chain transfers and more:

- **[Axelarscan for MainNet](https://axelarscan.io/){target=_blank}**
- **[Axelarscan for TestNet](https://testnet.axelarscan.io/){target=_blank}**

## Contracts {: #contracts }
