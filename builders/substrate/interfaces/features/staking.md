# The Parachain Staking Pallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) system that determines which collators are eligible to produce blocks based on their total stake in the network. For general information on staking, such as general terminology, staking variables, and more, please refer to the [Staking on Moonbeam](/learn/features/staking/){target=\_blank} page.

The DPoS system is powered by the [parachain staking](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/tree/master/pallets/parachain-staking/src){target=\_blank} pallet, allowing token holders (delegators) to express exactly which collator candidates they would like to support and with what quantity of stake. The design of the parachain staking pallet is such that it enforces shared risk/reward on chain between delegators and candidates.

Some of the functionality of the parachain staking pallet is also available through a staking precompile. The precompile is a Solidity interface that enables you to perform staking actions through the Ethereum API. Please refer to the [Staking Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/staking/){target=\_blank} guide for more information.

This guide will provide an overview of the extrinsics, storage methods, and getters for the pallet constants available in the parachain staking pallet.

## Exit Delays {: #exit-delays }

Some of the staking pallet extrinsics include exit delays that you must wait before the request can be executed. The exit delays to note are as follows:
