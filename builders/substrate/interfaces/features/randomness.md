# The Randomness Pallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam utilizes verifiable random functions (VRF) to generate randomness that can be verified on-chain. A VRF is a cryptographic function that takes some input and produces random values, along with a proof of authenticity that these random values were generated by the submitter. The proof can be verified by anyone to ensure the random values generated were calculated correctly. For more information on Moonbeam's on-chain randomness, such as an overview on the randomness sources, the request and fulfill cycle, and more, please refer to the [Randomness on Moonbeam](/learn/features/randomness/){target=\_blank} overview page.

The randomness pallet enables you to check on randomness requests that have not been fulfilled or purged, randomness results, and more. To actually request and fulfill randomness, you can use the randomness precompile and randomness consumer contracts. The precompile is a Solidity interface that enables you to request randomness, check on the status of requests, fulfill requests, and more through the Ethereum API. For more information on how to use both of these contracts, please refer to the [Randomness Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/){target=\_blank} guide.

This page will provide an overview of the storage methods and getters for the pallet constants available in the randomness pallet.

## Randomness Pallet Interface {: #randomness-pallet-interface }

### Storage Methods {: #storage-methods }

The randomness pallet includes the following read-only storage methods to obtain chain state data:

??? function "**localVrfOutput**() - returns the current local per-block VRF randomness"

    === "Parameters"

        None

    === "Returns"

        `H256` - A 32-byte (256-bit) hex value, starting with "0x"`

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/randomness/local-vrf-output.js'
        ```

??? function "**palletVersion**() - returns the current pallet version"

    === "Parameters"

        None

    === "Returns"

        `u16` - The pallet version

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/randomness/pallet-version.js'
        ```

??? function "**randomnessResults**(PalletRandomnessRequestType) - snapshot of randomness to fulfill all requests that are for the same raw randomness"

    === "Parameters"

        - `PalletRandomnessRequestType` - You can optionally provide the type of randomness you'd like, e.g. `Local` or `BabeEpoch` Randomness. If you omit this, you'll receive all types of randomness. 

    === "Returns"

        The query returns mappings of request types to their randomness outcomes, where:

        1. Key: Identifies the source and timing of the randomness request. e.g. `{ Local: '4,619,640' }` indicates this was a Local randomness request from block number 4,619,640. The Local type uses block numbers as identifiers, while BabeEpoch uses epoch numbers.

        2. Value: Contains two pieces of information, including `randomness`: A 32-byte hex string (0x15b5f6...c816) representing the random value generated and `requestCount`: The number of requests that used this same random value (e.g. '1')

        Multiple requests for randomness at the same block/epoch would share the same random value, which is why there's a requestCount field.

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/randomness/randomness-results.js'
        ```

??? function "**relayEpoch**() - returns the relay epoch"

    === "Parameters"

        None

    === "Returns"

        `u64` -  the relay epoch

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/randomness/check-epoch.js'
        ```

??? function "**requestCount**() - returns the number of randomness requests made so far, and is used to generate the next request's uid"

    === "Parameters"

        None

    === "Returns"

        `u64` -  the request count

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/randomness/request-count.js'
        ```

??? function "**requests**(u64) - returns a given randomness request or all of the randomness requests that have not been fulfilled nor purged yet"

    === "Parameters"

        - `u64` - The request ID number (optional)

    === "Returns"

        Returns an Option containing the request information if it exists and hasn't been fulfilled/purged, including:

        - The request type (Local or Babe)
        - When it can be fulfilled
        - Number of random words requested
        - The requester's information
