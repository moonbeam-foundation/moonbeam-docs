# The Referenda Pallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Referenda Pallet allows token holders to make, delegate, and manage Conviction-weighted votes on referenda.

Governance-related functionality is based on three new pallets and precompiles: the [Preimage Pallet](/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/governance/preimage/){target=\_blank} and [Preimage Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/governance/preimage/){target=\_blank}, the [Referenda Pallet](/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/governance/referenda/){target=\_blank} and [Referenda Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/governance/referenda/){target=\_blank}, and the [Conviction Voting Pallet](/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/governance/conviction-voting/){target=\_blank} and [Conviction Voting Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/governance/conviction-voting/){target=\_blank}. The aforementioned precompiles are Solidity interfaces that enable you to perform governance functions using the Ethereum API.

This guide will provide an overview of the extrinsics, storage methods, and getters for the pallet constants available in the Referenda Pallet on Moonbeam. This guide assumes you are familiar with governance-related terminology, if not, please check out the [governance overview page](/learn/features/governance/#opengov){target=\_blank} for more information.

## Referenda Pallet Interface {: #referenda-pallet-interface }

### Extrinsics {: #extrinsics }

The Referenda Pallet provides the following extrinsics (functions):

??? function "**cancel**(index) - cancels an ongoing referendum given the index of the referendum to cancel. This type of action requires a proposal to be created and assigned to either the Root Track or the Emergency Canceller Track"

    === "Parameters"

        - `index` - the index of the referendum to cancel

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/referenda/cancel.js'
        ```

??? function "**kill**(index) - cancels an ongoing referendum and slashes the deposits given the index of the referendum to cancel. This type of action requires a proposal to be created and assigned to either the Root Track or the Emergency Killer Track"

    === "Parameters"

        - `index` - the index of the referendum to kill

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/referenda/kill.js'
        ```

??? function "**placeDecisionDeposit**(index) - posts the Decision Deposit for a referendum, given the index of the referendum"

    === "Parameters"

        - `index` - the index of the referendum to place the Decision Deposit for

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/referenda/place-decision-deposit.js'
        ```

??? function "**refundDecisionDeposit**(index) - refunds the Decision Deposit for a closed referendum back to the depositor, given the index of the referendum"

    === "Parameters"

        - `index` - the index of the referendum to refund the Decision Deposit for

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/referenda/refund-decision-deposit.js'
        ```

??? function "**refundSubmissionDeposit**(index) - refunds the Submission Deposit for a closed referendum back to the depositor, given the index of the referendum"

    === "Parameters"

        - `index` - the index of the referendum to refund the Submission Deposit for

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/referenda/refund-submission-deposit.js'
        ```

??? function "**submit**(proposalOrigin, proposal, enactmentMoment) - proposes a referendum on a privileged action given the Origin from which the proposal should be executed, the proposal, and the moment that the proposal should be enacted"

    === "Parameters"

        - `proposalOrigin` - the Origin and, by extension, the Track from which the proposal should be executed. Typically, this should be set to one of the following:
            - `system` - indicates the proposal should be executed by a system-level Origin. You can specify the name of the Origin or the index associated with the Origin:
                - `Root` or `0` - submits a proposal to the Root Track
            - `Origins` - indicates the proposal should be executed by one of the governance Origins. To submit a proposal to any of the Tracks aside from Root, you can specify the name of the Origin or the index associated with the Origin:
                - `WhitelistedCaller` or `0` - submits a proposal to the Whitelisted Track
                - `GeneralAdmin` or `1` - submits a proposal to the General Admin Track
                - `ReferendumCanceller` or `2` - submits a proposal to the Emergency Canceller Track
                - `ReferendumKiller` or `3` - submits a proposal to the Emergency Killer Track
        - `proposal` - the action being proposed. To define the proposal to submit, you can use the following method: 
            - `Lookup` - defines the preimage associated with the proposal using the following arguments:
                - `hash_` - the hash of the preimage
                - `len` - the length of the preimage
        - `enactmentMoment` - when the proposal will be executed, either at a specific block or after a specific number of blocks:
            - `At` -  a specific block to enact the proposal at
            - `After` - the number of blocks to delay enactment after proposal approval

    === "Polkadot.js API Example"

        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/referenda/submit.js'
        ```
