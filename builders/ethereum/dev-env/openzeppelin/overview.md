# OpenZeppelin

## Introduction {: #introduction } 

[OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com){target=\_blank} is well known in the Ethereum developer community as their set of audited smart contracts and libraries are a standard in the industry. For example, most of the tutorials that show developers how to deploy an ERC-20 token use OpenZeppelin contracts.

You can find more information about OpenZeppelin on their [documentation site](https://docs.openzeppelin.com){target=\_blank}.

As part of its Ethereum compatibility features, OpenZeppelin products can be seamlessly used on Moonbeam. This page will provide information on different OpenZeppelin solutions that you can test.
