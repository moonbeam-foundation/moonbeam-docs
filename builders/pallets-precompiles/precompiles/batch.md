# Interacting with the Batch Precompile

![Precomiled Contracts Banner](/images/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/batch-banner.png)

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The batch precompiled contract on Moonbeam allows developers to combine multiple EVM calls into one.

Currently, having users interact with multiple contracts would require multiple transaction confirmations in the user's wallet. An example would be approving a smart contract's access to a token, then transferring it. With the batch precompile, developers can enhance user experience with batched transactions as it minimizes the number of transactions a user is required to confirm to one. Additionally, gas fees can be reduced since batching avoids multiple base gas fees (the initial 21000 units of gas spent to begin a transaction).

The precompile interacts directly with [Substrate's EVM pallet](/learn/features/eth-compatibility#evm-pallet){target=_blank}. The caller of the batch function will have their address act as the `msg.sender` for all subtransactions, but unlike [delegate calls](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries){target=_blank}, the target contract will still affect its own storage. It is effectively the same as if the user signed multiple transactions, but with only one confirmation.

The precompile is located at the following address:

=== "Moonbeam"
     ```
     {{networks.moonbeam.precompiles.batch }}
     ```

=== "Moonriver"
     ```
     {{networks.moonriver.precompiles.batch }}
     ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"
     ```
     {{networks.moonbase.precompiles.batch }}
     ```

## The Batch Solidity Interface {: #the-batch-interface }

[`Batch.sol`](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/batch/Batch.sol){target=_blank} is a Solidity interface that allows developers to interact with the precompile's three methods.

--8<-- 'text/batch/batch-interface.md'

## Interact with the Solidity Interface {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface }

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have:

- [MetaMask installed and connected to Moonbase Alpha](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=_blank}
- Create or have two accounts on Moonbase Alpha to test out the different features in the batch precompile
- At least one of the accounts will need to be funded with `DEV` tokens.
 --8<-- 'text/faucet/faucet-list-item.md'

### Example Contract {: #example-contract}

The contract `SimpleContract.sol` will be used as an example of batching contract interactions, but in practice, any contract can be interacted with.

 --8<-- 'code/batch/simple-contract.md'

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

You can interact with the batch precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=_blank}. You'll need a copy of [`Batch.sol`](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/batch/Batch.sol){target=_blank} and [`SimpleContract.sol`](#example-contract). To add the precompile to Remix and follow along with the tutorial, you will need to:

1. Click on the **File explorer** tab
2. Paste the `Batch.sol` contract into a Remix file named **Batch.sol**
3. Paste the `SimpleContract.sol` contract into a Remix file named **SimpleContract.sol**

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract }

Next, you will need to compile both files in Remix:

1. Make sure that you have the **Batch.sol** file open
2. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
3. To compile the contract, click on **Compile Batch.sol**

!!! note
    With the release of [Solidity v0.8.20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20){target=_blank}, support for the Shanghai hard fork has been introduced, which includes `PUSH0` opcodes in the generated bytecode. Support for the `PUSH0` opcode on Moonbeam hasn't been rolled out yet. As such, if you'd like to use Solidity v0.8.20, you'll need to modify some configurations. From the **Advanced Configurations** dropdown, you can set the **EVM VERSION** to **london**.

    If you attempt to use the default compiler of Solidity v0.8.20, you will see the following error:

    ```
    {'code': -32603, 'message': 'evm error: InvalidCode(Opcode(95))', 'data': '0x'}
    ```

![Compiling Batch.sol](/images/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/batch-1.png)

If the interface was compiled successfully, you will see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab.

### Access the Precompile {: #access-the-precompile }

Instead of deploying the batch precompile, you will access the interface given the address of the precompiled contract:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Please note the precompiled contract is already deployed
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - Metamask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Provider - Metamask**, you might be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **Batch - Batch.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Since this is a precompiled contract, there is no need to deploy any code. Instead we are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
5. Provide the address of the batch precompile: `{{networks.moonbase.precompiles.batch}}` and click **At Address**

![Access the address](/images/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/batch-2.png)

The **BATCH** precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Deploy Example Contract {: #deploy-example-contract }

On the other hand, `SimpleContract.sol` will be deployed as a new contract. Before starting this section, repeat the [compilation step](#compile-the-contract) with the `SimpleContract.sol` file.

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - Metamask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Provider - Metamask**, you might be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **SimpleContract - SimpleContract.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown
5. Click **Deploy**
6. Confirm the MetaMask transaction that appears by clicking **Confirm**

![Deploy SimpleContract](/images/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/batch-3.png)

The **SIMPLECONTRACT** contract will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Send Native Currency via Precompile {: #send-native-currency-via-precompile }

Sending native currency with the batch precompile is more involved than pressing a few buttons in Remix or MetaMask. For this example, you will be using the **batchAll** function to send native currency atomically.

Transactions have a value field to specify the amount of native currency being sent with it. In Remix, this is represented by the **VALUE** input in the **DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS** tab. However, for the batch precompile, this data is provided within the **value** array input of the batch functions.

Try transferring native currency to two wallets of your choice via the batch precompile on Moonbase Alpha:

1. Make sure that you have at least 0.5 DEV in your connected wallet
2. Expand the batch contract under **Deployed Contracts**
3. Expand the **batchAll** function
4. For the **to** input, insert your addresses in the following format: `["ADDRESS-1-HERE", "ADDRESS-2-HERE"]`, where the first address corresponds to the first wallet of your choice and the second address corresponds to the second wallet of your choice
5. For the **value** input, insert the amount you wish to transfer in Wei for each address. For example, `["100000000000000000", "200000000000000000"]` will transfer 0.1 DEV to the first address and 0.2 DEV to the second address
6. For both of the remaining **callData** and **gasLimit** inputs, insert `[]`. Call data and gas limit are not a concern for transferring native currency
7. Press **transact**
8. Press **Confirm** in the MetaMask extension to confirm the transaction

![Send Batch Transfer](/images/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/batch-4.png)

Once the transaction is complete, be sure to check both of the accounts' balances, either in MetaMask or in a [block explorer](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=_blank}. Congratulations! You've now sent a batched transfer via the batch precompile.

!!! note
     Typically if you wanted to send the native currency to or through a contract, you would have to set the value within the overall transaction object and interact with a payable function. However, since the batch precompile interacts directly with Substrate code, this is not a typical Ethereum transaction and is thus not necessary.

### Find a Contract Interaction's Call Data {: #find-a-contract-interactions-call-data }

Visual interfaces like [Remix](/builders/build/eth-api/dev-env/remix){target=_blank} and handy libraries like [Ethers.js](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries/ethersjs){target=_blank} hide the way that Ethereum transactions interact with Solidity smart contracts. The name and input types of a function are hashed into a [function selector](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#function-selector-and-argument-encoding){target=_blank} and the input data is encoded. These two pieces are then combined and sent as the transaction's call data. To send a subtransaction within a batch transaction, the sender needs to know its call data beforehand. 

Try finding a transaction's call data using Remix:

1. Expand the `SimpleContract.sol` contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. Expand the **setMessage** function
3. Enter the input of the function. For this example, **id** will be `1` and **message** will be `"moonbeam"`
4. Instead of sending the transaction, click the copy button next to the **transact** button to copy the call data

![Transaction Call Data](/images/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/batch-5.png)

Now you have the transaction's call data! Considering the example values of `1` and `"moonbeam"`, we can keep an eye out for their encoded values in the call data:

 --8<-- 'code/batch/simple-message-call-data.md'

The call data can be broken into five lines, where:

 - The first line is the function selector
 - The second line is equal to 1, which is the **id** that was provided
 - What's left has to do with the **message** input. These last three lines are tricky, since strings are a [dynamic type](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/abi-spec.html#use-of-dynamic-types){target=_blank} with a dynamic length. The third line refers to an offset to define where the string's data starts. The fourth line refers to the string's length, in this case 8 because "moonbeam" is 8 bytes long . Finally, the fifth line is "moonbeam" in hexadecimal format (8 ASCII characters are 16 hexidecimal characters) left aligned and with zeros for padding

### Function Interaction via Precompile {: #function-interaction-via-precompile }

This section's example will be using the **batchAll** function that will ensure the transactions are resolved atomically. Keep in mind that there are also two other batch functions that can either continue subtransactions despite errors or halt subsequent subtransactions but not revert previous ones.

Interacting with a function is very similar to [sending a native currency](#send-native-currency-via-precompile), since they are both transactions. However, call data is required to properly provide input to functions and a sender may desire to limit the amount of gas spent in each subtransaction.

The `callData` and `gasLimit` fields are more relevant for subtransactions that interact with contracts. For each function in the batch interface, the `callData` input is an array where each index corresponds to the call data for each recipient of the subtransaction, that is, each `to` input. If the size of the `callData` array is less than the `to` array, the remaining subtransactions will have no call data (functions with no inputs). The `gasLimit` input is an array that corresponds to the amount of gas that each can spend for each subtransaction. If its value at an index is 0 or the index is the size of the array or greater (and smaller than the `to` array's size), all of the remaining gas from the previous subtransaction is forwarded.

To use the precompile to send an atomic batch transaction, take the following steps:

1. Copy the `SimpleContract.sol` contract's address with the copy button on the right side of its header. Be sure to also have the [call data from the previous section](#finding-a-contract-interactions-call-data) 
2. Expand the batch contract under **Deployed Contracts**
3. Expand the **batchAll** function
4. For the **to** input, insert the address of the `SimpleContract.sol` contract that you previously copied in the following format: `["SIMPLE-CONTRACT-ADDRESS-HERE"]`
5. For the value input, since `SimpleContract.sol` does not require any native currency to be paid to it, insert `["0"]` for 0 Wei
6. For the **callData** input, insert your call data from the previous section in the following format: `["CALL-DATA-HERE"]`
7. For the **gasLimit** input, insert `[]`. You can put in a gas limit value, but it is optional 
8. Press **transact**
9. Press **Confirm** in the MetaMask extension to confirm the transaction

![Batch Function Interaction](/images/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/batch-6.png)

If you used the same call data as the tutorial, check to make sure that the transaction has been successful:

1. Expand the `SimpleContract.sol` contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. To the right of the **messages** button, insert `1`
3. Press the blue **messages** button

![SimpleContract Confirmation](/images/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/batch/batch-7.png)

The phrase **"moonbeam"** should appear underneath it. Congratulations! You have interacted with a function with the batch precompile.

### Combining Subtransactions {: combining-subtransactions }

So far, transferring native currency and interacting with functions have been separate, but they can be intertwined.

The following four strings can be combined as inputs for a batch transaction. They will transact 1 DEV to the public Gerald (`0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b`) account, and interact with a predeployed `SimpleContract.sol` contract twice. Here is a break-down:

There are three subtransactions, so there are three addresses in the `to` input array. The first is the public Gerald account, the next two are a predeployed `SimpleContract.sol` contract. You can replace the last two with your own instance of `SimpleContract.sol` if you wish. Or, replace only one: you can interact with multiple contracts in a single message.

```
[
  "0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b",
  "0xd14b70a55F6cBAc06d4FA49b99be0370D0e1BD39", 
  "0xd14b70a55F6cBAc06d4FA49b99be0370D0e1BD39"
]
``` 

There will also be three values for the `value` array. The first address in the `to` input array has to do with sending 1 DEV, so 1 DEV in Wei is within the array. The following two values are 0 because the function that their subtransactions are interacting with do not accept or require native currency.  

```
["1000000000000000000", "0", "0"]
```

You will need three values for the `callData` array. Since transferring native currency does not require call data, the string is simply blank. The second and third values in the array correspond to invokations of **setMessage** that set messages to ids 5 and 6.

```
[
  "0x", 
  "0x648345c8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009796f752061726520610000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", 
  "0x648345c800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e61206d6f6f6e6265616d2070726f000000000000000000000000000000000000"
]
```

The final input is for `gas_input`. This array will be left empty to forward all remaining gas to each subtransaction.

```
[]
```

Try sending a batched transaction with these inputs in Remix the same way [you batched a function call](#function-interaction-via-precompile).

And that's it! You've successfully interacted with the ERC-20 precompile using MetaMask and Remix!

## Ethereum Development Libraries {: #ethereum-development-libraries }

If you have followed the [Ethers.js tutorial](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=_blank} on Moonbeam, you may find it difficult to find the call data for a function. The answer is hidden within Ether's `Interface` object, where the [encodeFunctionData](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/abi/#Interface-encodeFunctionData){target=_blank} function allows you to input your function name and inputs to receive the resultant call data. [Web3.js](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries/web3js){target=_blank} has a similar function, [encodeFunctionCall](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-abi.html#encodefunctioncall){target=_blank}.

!!! note
    The code snippets presented in the following sections are not meant for production environments. Please make sure you adapt it for each use-case.

=== "Web3.js"
     --8<-- 'code/batch/web3js-batch.md'

=== "Ethers.js"
     --8<-- 'code/batch/ethers-batch.md'

=== "Web3.py"
     --8<-- 'code/batch/web3py-batch.md'

Afterwards, you should be all set to interact with the batch precompile as one typically would with a contract in [Ethers](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries/ethersjs){target=_blank}.
