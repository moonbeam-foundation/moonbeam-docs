# Using the PolkadotXCM Pallet To Send XC-20s

## Introduction {: #introduction }

!!! note

    The PolkadotXCM Pallet replaces the deprecated XTokens Pallet. Accordingly, ensure that you are using the PolkadotXCM Pallet to interact with XC-20s.

Manually crafting an XCM message for fungible asset transfers is a challenging task. Consequently, developers can leverage wrapper functions and pallets to use XCM features on Polkadot and Kusama. One example of such wrappers is the [XCM](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-pallet){target=\_blank} Pallet, which provides different methods to transfer fungible assets via XCM.

This guide will show you how to leverage the PolkadotXCM Pallet to send [XC-20s](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/){target=\_blank} from a Moonbeam-based network to other chains in the ecosystem (relay chain/parachains).

**Developers must understand that sending incorrect XCM messages can result in the loss of funds.** Consequently, testing XCM features on a TestNet is essential before moving to a production environment.

## Nomenclature {: #nomenclature }

Because there are various XCM-related pallets and precompiles with similar-sounding names, the following section will clarify the differences between each. 

- `PolkadotXCM` - this pallet (and the focus of this page) enables you to interact with XC-20s on Moonbeam, replacing the deprecated `XTokens` pallet 
- `pallet-xcm`- the general Polkadot XCM pallet allows you to interact with cross-chain assets. Moonbeam's `PolkadotXCM` pallet is essentially a wrapper of `pallet-xcm`. Because of this, you may see `PolkadotXCM` and `pallet-xcm` referred to interchangeably
- `XTokens` - This pallet is now deprecated and replaced by `PolkadotXCM`
- `XCMInterface.sol` - This precompile is the solidity interface that replaces `XTokens.sol` and enables you to interact with the methods of `PolkadotXCM` from the EVM via a solidity interface

## PolkadotXCM Pallet Interface {: #polkadotxcm-pallet-interface }

### Extrinsics {: #extrinsics }

The PolkadotXCM Pallet provides the following extrinsics (functions):

??? function "**forceDefaultXcmVersion**(maybeXcmVersion) — sets a safe default XCM version for message encoding (admin origins only)"
    === "Parameters"
           - `maybeXcmVersion` - the default XCM encoding version to be used when a destination's supported version is unknown. Can be either:
               - A version number
               - `None` to disable the default version setting

??? function "**transferAssets**(dest, beneficiary, assets, feeAssetItem, weightLimit) — transfers assets from the local chain to a destination chain using reserve or teleport methods"
    === "Parameters"
           - `dest` - the destination context for the assets. Typically specified as:
               - `X2(Parent, Parachain(..))` for parachain to parachain transfers
               - `X1(Parachain(..))` for relay to parachain transfers
           - `beneficiary` - the recipient location in the context of the destination. Generally an `AccountId32` value
           - `assets` - the assets to be transferred. Must:
               - Have the same reserve location or be teleportable to destination (excluding fee assets)
               - Include assets for fee payment
           - `feeAssetItem` - the index in the `assets` array indicating which asset should be used to pay fees
           - `weightLimit` - the weight limit for XCM fee purchase on the destination chain. Can be defined as:
               - `Unlimited` - allows an unlimited amount of weight
               - `Limited` - specifies a maximum weight value

        The transfer behavior varies based on asset type:

           - **Local Reserve**: 
               - Transfers assets to destination chain's sovereign account
               - Sends XCM to mint and deposit reserve-based assets to beneficiary
           
           - **Destination Reserve**:
               - Burns local assets
               - Notifies destination to withdraw reserves from this chain's sovereign account
               - Deposits to beneficiary
           
           - **Remote Reserve**:
               - Burns local assets
               - Sends XCM to move reserves between sovereign accounts
               - Notifies destination to mint and deposit to beneficiary
           
           - **Teleport**:
               - Burns local assets
               - Sends XCM to mint/teleport assets and deposit to beneficiary

           As a reminder, the origin must be capable of both withdrawing the specified assets and executing XCM. If more weight is needed than specified in `weightLimit`, the operation will fail and teleported assets may be at risk


??? function "**transferAssetsUsingTypeAndThen**(dest, assets, assetsTransferType, remoteFeesId, feesTransferType, customXcmOnDest, weightLimit) — transfers assets with explicit transfer types and custom destination behavior"
    === "Parameters"
           - `dest` - the destination context for the assets. Can be specified as:
               - `[Parent, Parachain(..)]` for parachain to parachain transfers
               - `[Parachain(..)]` for relay to parachain transfers
               - `(parents: 2, (GlobalConsensus(..), ..))` for cross-bridge ecosystem transfers
           - `assets` - the assets to be transferred. Must either:
               - Have the same reserve location
               - Be teleportable to destination
           - `assetsTransferType` - specifies how the main assets should be transferred:
               - `LocalReserve` - transfers to sovereign account, mints at destination
               - `DestinationReserve` - burns locally, withdraws from sovereign account at destination
               - `RemoteReserve(reserve)` - burns locally, moves reserves through specified chain (typically Asset Hub)
               - `Teleport` - burns locally, mints/teleports at destination
           - `remoteFeesId` - specifies which of the included assets should be used for fee payment
           - `feesTransferType` - specifies how the fee payment asset should be transferred (same options as `assetsTransferType`)
           - `customXcmOnDest` - XCM instructions to execute on the destination chain as the final step. Typically used to:
               - Deposit assets to beneficiary: `Xcm(vec![DepositAsset { assets: Wild(AllCounted(assets.len())), beneficiary }])`
               - Or perform more complex operations with the transferred assets
           - `weightLimit` - the weight limit for XCM fee purchase on the destination chain. Can be defined as:
               - `Unlimited` - allows an unlimited amount of weight
               - `Limited` - specifies a maximum weight value


        A few reminders:

        - `BuyExecution` is used to purchase execution time using the specified `remoteFeesId` asset
        - Fee payment asset can use a different transfer type than the main assets
        - The origin must be capable of both withdrawing the specified assets and executing XCM
        - If more weight is needed than specified in `weightLimit`, the operation will fail and transferred assets may be at risk

### Storage Methods {: #storage-methods }

The PolkadotXCM Pallet includes the following read-only storage methods. Note, this is not an exhaustive list. To see the current available storage methods, check the [Chain State of Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate){target=\_blank}.

???+ function "**assetTraps**(h256 hash) — returns the count of trapped assets for a given hash"
    === "Parameters"

### Pallet Constants {: #constants }

There are no constants part of the PolkadotXCM pallet.

## Building an XCM Message with the PolkadotXCM Pallet {: #build-with-PolkadotXCM-pallet}

This guide covers the process of building an XCM message using the PolkadotXCM Pallet, specifically the `transferAssets` function.

!!! note
    Each parachain can allow and forbid specific methods from a pallet. Consequently, developers must ensure that they use methods that are allowed, or the transaction will fail with an error similar to `system.CallFiltered`.

You'll be transferring xcUNIT tokens, which are the [XC-20](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/){target=\_blank} representation of the Alphanet relay chain token, UNIT. You can adapt this guide for any other XC-20.

### Checking Prerequisites {: #polkadotxcm-check-prerequisites}

To follow along with the examples in this guide, you need to have the following:

- An account with funds.
 --8<-- 'text/_common/faucet/faucet-list-item.md'
- Some xcUNIT tokens. You can swap DEV tokens (Moonbase Alpha's native token) for xcUNITs on [Moonbeam-Swap](https://moonbeam-swap.netlify.app/#/swap){target=\_blank}, a demo Uniswap-V2 clone on Moonbase Alpha

    !!! note
        You can adapt this guide to transfer another [external XC-20 or a local XC-20](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/){target=\_blank}. For external XC-20s, you'll need the asset ID and the number of decimals the asset has. For local XC-20s, you'll need the contract address.

    ![Moonbeam Swap xcUNIT](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xtokens-pallet/xtokens-1.webp)

To check your xcUNIT balance, you can add the XC-20's [precompile address](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/#calculate-xc20-address){target=\_blank} to MetaMask with the following address:

```text
0xFfFFfFff1FcaCBd218EDc0EbA20Fc2308C778080
```

### PolkadotXCM Transfer Assets Function {: #polkadotxcm-transfer-assets-function}

In this example, you'll build an XCM message to transfer xcUNIT from Moonbase Alpha back to the Alphanet relay chain through the `transferAssets` function of the PolkadotXcm Pallet using the [Polkadot.js API](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}.

To perform a limited reserve transfer using the `polkadotXcm` pallet, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: `@polkadot/api` for blockchain interaction, `@polkadot/util` for utility functions, and `@polkadot/util-crypto` for cryptographic functions.

2. Set up your network connection by creating a WebSocket provider using the Moonbase Alpha endpoint: `wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network`. Initialize the Polkadot API with this provider.

3. Configure your account using the Ethereum format. Create a keyring instance for Ethereum addresses, then add your account using your private key. Remember to prepend the private key with `0x`, which is omitted when exporting your keys from MetaMask 

    !!! remember
        This is for demo purposes only. Never store your private key in a JavaScript file.

4. Prepare the destination address by converting the SS58 format address to raw bytes using the `decodeAddress` function. If the destination SS58 address is already in hexadecimal format, no conversion is needed 

5. Construct the XCM transfer transaction with: the relay chain as the destination (parent chain with `parents: 1`), beneficiary (using `AccountId32` format), assets (amount with 12 decimals), fee asset item (0), and weight limit ('Unlimited').

    ??? code "Define the destination, beneficiary, and asset"
        ```js
        --8<-- 'code/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/polkadot-xcm/destination-beneficiary-fee.js'
        ```

6. Submit your transaction and implement monitoring logic with error handling 

7. Once the transaction is finalized, the script will automatically exit. Any errors during the process will be logged to the console for troubleshooting


???+ code "View the full script"
    ```js
    --8<-- 'code/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/polkadot-xcm/send-xcm.js'
    ```

!!! note
    You can view an example of the above script, which sends 1 xcUNIT to Alice's account on the relay chain, on [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/extrinsics/decode/0x1c0b0401000400010100d4620637e11439598c5fbae0506dc68b9fb1edb33b316761bf99987a1034a96b0404010000070010a5d4e80000000000){target=\_blank} using the following encoded calldata: `0x1c0b0401000400010100d4620637e11439598c5fbae0506dc68b9fb1edb33b316761bf99987a1034a96b0404010000070010a5d4e80000000000`.

Once the transaction is processed, the target account on the relay chain should have received the transferred amount minus a small fee that is deducted to execute the XCM on the destination chain. 

#### Troubleshooting

If you're having difficulty replicating the demo, take the following troubleshooting steps:

 - Ensure your sending account is funded with DEV tokens 
 - Ensure your sending account is funded with xcUNIT tokens (or another XC-20 that you have specified)
 - Check the [Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmoonbase-alpha.public.blastapi.io#/explorer){target=\_blank} on Polkadot.js Apps on Moonbase Alpha to ensure a successful transaction on the origin chain
 - Check the [Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frelay.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank} on Polkadot.js Apps and review the XCM messages received on Moonbase Relay Chain
