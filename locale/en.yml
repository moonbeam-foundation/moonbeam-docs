  staking_risks: |-
    ## Risks {: #risks }

    *Holders of MOVR/GLMR tokens should perform careful due diligence on collators before delegating. Being listed as a collator is not an endorsement or recommendation from the Moonbeam Network, the Moonriver Network, or Moonbeam Foundation. Neither the Moonbeam Network, Moonriver Network, nor Moonbeam Foundation has vetted the list collators and assumes no responsibility with regard to the selection, performance, security, accuracy, or use of any third-party offerings.  You alone are responsible for doing your own diligence to understand the applicable fees and all risks present, including actively monitoring the activity of your collators.*

    *You agree and understand that neither the Moonbeam Network, the Moonriver Network, nor Moonbeam Foundation guarantees that you will receive staking rewards and any applicable percentage provided (i) is an estimate only and not guaranteed, (ii) may change at any time and (iii) may be more or less than the actual staking rewards you receive. The Moonbeam Foundation makes no representations as to the monetary value of any rewards at any time.*

    *Staking MOVR/GLMR tokens is not free of risk.*
  staking_risks_part_2: |-
    *Additionally, if a collator fails to perform required functions or acts in bad faith, a portion of their total stake can be slashed (i.e. destroyed). This includes the stake of their delegators. If a collators behaves suspiciously or is too often offline, delegators can choose to unbond from them or switch to another collator. Delegators can also mitigate risk by electing to distribute their stake across multiple collators.*

common:
  assumes_mac_or_ubuntu_env: |-
    The examples in this guide assume you have a MacOS or Ubuntu 22.04-based environment and will need to be adapted accordingly for Windows.
  async_backing: |-
    !!! note
        As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.
  endpoint_examples_list_item: |-
    To test out the examples in this guide on Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}
  endpoint_examples: |-
    To test out the examples in this guide on Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.
  endpoint_setup: |-
    To configure your project for Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.
  install_nodejs: |-
    You need to install Node.js (for this example, you can use v16.x) and the npm package manager. You can download directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager){target=\_blank} or in your terminal:

    === "Ubuntu"

        ```bash
        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -

        sudo apt install -y nodejs
        ```

    === "MacOS"

        ```bash
        # You can use homebrew (https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
        brew install node

        # Or you can use nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
        nvm install node
        ```

    You can verify that everything is installed correctly by querying the version for each package:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```
