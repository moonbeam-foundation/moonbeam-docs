# Telemetry for a Full Node

![Telemetry Moonbeam Banner](/images/fullnode/telemetry-banner.png)

## Introduction

With the release of Moonbase Alpha v6, you can spin up a node that connects to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. You can check those steps in [this tutorial](/node-operators/networks/full-node/).

This guide will provide the necessary steps to enable the telemetry server for your Moonbase Alpha node.

!!! note
    The steps described in this guide are for a telemetry instance different than the standard Polkadot telemetry enabled by default (you can run nodes with no telemetry by using the `--no-telemetry` flag). The steps described in this guide are mandatory only for collator nodes.

## Telemetry Exporter Summary

Moonbeam will run a telemetry server that collects Prometheus metrics from all the Moonbeam parachain nodes on the network. Running this will be a great help to us during our development phase.  

The metrics exporter can run either as a kubernetes sidecar, or as a local binary if you are running a VM. It will push data out to our servers, so you do not have to enable any incoming ports for this service.

We are using a service called [Gantree Node Watchdog](https://github.com/gantree-io/gantree-node-watchdog) to upload telemetry automatically.  Once you enable telemetry, you can also access a Prometheus/Grafana server from the [Gantree App](https://app.gantree.io/).  There are detailed instructions on the GitHub repository. If you need more info, here is a quick start. 

For now, we need to run two node watchdogs, one for the parachain and one for the relay chain.  This will be updated in a future release. 

For help, contact our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FQXm74UQ7V) or the [Gantree Discord](https://discord.gg/N95McPjHZ2). 
 
## Checking Prerequisites

Before following this tutorial, you need to:

 1. Log in to [https://app.gantree.io](https://app.gantree.io) and create an account.  Navigate to API keys and copy your API key. 
 2. Request a PCK key in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FQXm74UQ7V)
   
## Telemetry Exporter with Docker

We will run two instances of the Gantree node watchdog using Docker: one for the parachain and one for the relay chain.  

### Required Configuration Information

- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_API_KEY
- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_PROJECT_ID
- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_CLIENT_ID
- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_PCKRC
- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_METRICS_HOST

### Instructions

First, clone the instance monitoring client repository and build the docker image:

```
git clone https://github.com/gantree-io/gantree-node-watchdog
cd gantree-node-watchdog
# checkout latest release
git checkout tags/$(git tag | tail -1)
docker build .  
# get the IMAGE-NAME for use below
docker images
```

Next, let's run the docker container (parachain Gantree node watchdog). Note that you need to replace the following fields:

  - `IMAGE-NAME` witch the one fetched in the previous step
  - `YOUR-API-KEY` with the one provided by [https://app.gantree.io](https://app.gantree.io)
  - `YOUR-SERVER-NAME`
  - `YOUR-PCK-KEY` with the one requested in our Discord server

```
docker run -it --network="host" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_PROJECT_ID="moonbase-alpha" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_CLIENT_ID="YOUR-SERVER-NAME-parachain" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_PCKRC="YOUR-PCK-KEY" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_METRICS_HOST="http://127.0.0.1:9615" \
--name gantree_watchdog_parachain IMAGE-NAME
--chain alphanet
```

Now, we need to run the relay Gantree node watchdog. Note that you need to replace the same information as in the previous step.

```
docker run -it --network="host" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_PROJECT_ID="moonbase-alpha" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_CLIENT_ID="YOUR-SERVER-NAME-relay" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_PCKRC="YOUR-PCK-KEY" \
-e GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_METRICS_HOST="http://127.0.0.1:9616" \
--name gantree_watchdog_relay IMAGE-NAME
--chain alphanet
```

You should see waiting for provisioning in the logs.  Once it's complete, you can log into the [https://app.gantree.io](https://app.gantree.io) and select networks. You will see a `View Monitoring Dashboard` link to your custom Prometheus / Grafana dashboard which you can customize to your needs.  

Once things are working well, you can update the commands to run in daemon mode.  Remove `-it` and add `-d` to the command above.  

## Telemetry Exporter with Systemd

We will run two instances of the Gantree node watchdog: one for the parachain and one for the relay chain.  

### Required Configuration Information

- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_API_KEY
- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_PROJECT_ID
- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_CLIENT_ID
- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_PCKRC
- GANTREE_NODE_WATCHDOG_METRICS_HOST

### Instructions

First, we need to download the Gantree node watchdog binary from the [release page](https://github.com/gantree-io/gantree-node-watchdog/releases), and extract it to a folder, for example, `/usr/local/bin`.

Next, let's create two folders for the configuration files:

```
mkdir -p /var/lib/gantree/parachain
mkdir -p /var/lib/gantree/relay
```

Now, we need to generate the configuration files, place each in the folders created in the previous step. Note that you need to replace the following fields:

  - `YOUR-API-KEY` with the one provided by [https://app.gantree.io](https://app.gantree.io)
  - `YOUR-SERVER-NAME`
  - `YOUR-PCK-KEY` with the one requested in our Discord server

Parachain:

```
# Contents of /var/lib/gantree/parachain/.gnw_config.json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR-API-KEY",
  "project_id": "moonbase-alpha",
  "client_id": "YOUR-SERVER-NAME-parachain",
  "pckrc": "YOUR-PCK-KEY",
  "metrics_host": "http://127.0.0.1:9615"
}
```

Embedded relay chain:

```
# Contents of /var/lib/gantree/relay/.gnw_config.json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR-API-KEY",
  "project_id": "moonbase-alpha",
  "client_id": "YOUR-SERVER-NAME-relay",
  "pckrc": "YOUR-PCK-KEY",
  "metrics_host": "http://127.0.0.1:9616"
}
```

The next step is to generate your systemd configuration file.

Parachain:

```
# Contents of /etc/systemd/system/gantree-parachain.service

[Unit]
Description=Gantree Node Watchdog Parachain
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/gantree/parachain
Type=simple
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gantree_node_watchdog

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Embedded relay chain:

```
# Contents of /etc/systemd/system/gantree-relay.service

[Unit]
Description=Gantree Node Watchdog Relay
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/gantree/relay
Type=simple
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gantree_node_watchdog

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

We are almost there! Now, let's enable and start the systemd services, monitor logs for errors:

```
sudo systemctl enable gantree-parachain
sudo systemctl start gantree-parachain && journalctl -f -u gantree-parachain

sudo systemctl enable gantree-relay
sudo systemctl start gantree-relay && journalctl -f -u gantree-relay
```

You should see waiting for provisioning in the logs.  Once it's complete, you can log into the [https://app.gantree.io](https://app.gantree.io) and select networks. You will see a `View Monitoring Dashboard` link to your custom Prometheus / Grafana dashboard which you can customize to your needs.
