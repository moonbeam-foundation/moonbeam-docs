## Introduction {: #introduction } 

A single-signature wallet, or singlesig for short, is a wallet in which only one owner holds the private key, and therefore has control over all the assets that account holds. Moreover, if the private key is lost, then access to the wallet and the funds are lost forever. 

To solve this problem, multi-signature wallets, or multisig for short, have been introduced. With a multisig wallet there is more than one owner, so one owner could lose their keys and the others would still have access to the wallet and funds. In addition, multisig wallets can require threshold signing, where a proposal is only executed as a transaction if a certain amount of approvals are attained. Therefore creating an extra layer of security.

To help manage singlesig and multisig wallets, [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io){target=\_blank} was forked to create [Moonbeam Safe](https://multisig.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}. The Safe can be configured as a multisig contract that allows two or more owners to hold and transfer funds to and from the Safe. You can also configure the Safe to be a singlesig contract with only one owner. 

This guide will show you how to create a multisig Safe on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. You will also learn how to send DEV and ERC-20 tokens to and from the Safe, and how to interact with smart contracts using the Safe. This guide can be adapted for Moonbeam and Moonriver.

--8<-- 'text/_disclaimers/third-party-content-intro.md'

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

Before diving into the guide, you'll need to have a few [MetaMask accounts](#metamask-accounts) loaded up with funds, some [ERC-20 tokens](#erc20-tokens) on hand to send to the Safe, and a [deployed smart contract](#deployed-smart-contract) to interact with.

### MetaMask Accounts {: #metamask-accounts }

For this guide, you will be creating a Safe on Moonbase Alpha to interact and manage your funds with. To connect to the Safe, you will need to have:

 - MetaMask installed and [connected to Moonbase Alpha](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}
 - At least two accounts each loaded with funds.
 --8<-- 'text/_common/faucet/faucet-list-item.md'

You will need at least two accounts because you will be setting up a multisig Safe with 3 owners, and 2/3 confirmations for any transaction to get executed. Therefore, throughout this guide you will need to switch back and forth between at least two of the accounts to be able to confirm and send transactions. 

This guide will use the following accounts:

 - **Alice** — 0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac
 - **Bob** — 0x3Cd0A705a2DC65e5b1E1205896BaA2be8A07c6e0
 - **Charlie** — 0x798d4Ba9baf0064Ec19eB4F0a1a45785ae9D6DFc

### ERC-20 Tokens {: #erc20-tokens }

Later on in this guide, you will be learning how to send and receive ERC-20 tokens to and from the Safe. So you will need to have deployed some ERC-20 tokens and added them to your MetaMask account. To do so, you can check out the [Using Remix to Deploy to Moonbeam](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} guide, in particular the [Deploying a Contract to Moonbeam](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/#deploying-a-contract-to-moonbeam-using-remix){target=\_blank} and [Interact with a Moonbeam-based ERC-20](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/#interacting-with-a-moonbeam-based-erc-20-from-metamask){target=\_blank} sections will show you how to deploy an ERC-20 token and import it into MetaMask.

### Deployed Smart Contract {: #deployed-smart-contract }

Towards the end of this guide, you will be learning how to interact with a smart contract using the Safe. So you will need to have a smart contract deployed to interact with. If you would like detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Deploying a Contract to Moonbeam using Remix](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/#deploying-a-contract-to-moonbeam){target=\_blank} guide.

You can head to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank} and create a new file for the following `SetText.sol` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SetText {
    string public text;
    
    function setTextData(string calldata _text) public {
        text = _text;
    }
}
```

This is a simple contract with a single function, `setTextData`, that accepts a string and uses it to set the `text` variable.

You will need the contract address and the ABI, so make sure you have copied those somewhere or have access to them for later on.

## Create a Safe {: #create-a-safe }

To get started creating a Safe, navigate to the [Moonbeam Safe](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/?chain=mbase){target=\_blank}. For the purpose of this guide, you'll create a Safe on Moonbase Alpha, but you can also adapt the instructions to create a Safe on [Moonbeam](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/?chain=mbeam){target=\_blank} or [Moonriver](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/?chain=mriver){target=\_blank}. To switch networks, simply click the network dropdown in the top right hand corner of the page. 

### Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

Once on the [Moonbase Alpha](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/?chain=mbase){target=\_blank} page, you can begin to create a Safe by first connecting your wallet:

 1. Click **Connect Wallet**
 2. Select a wallet to connect to Moonbeam Safe. For this example you can use MetaMask. If MetaMask doesn't appear in the list of options, click **Show More** and select **MetaMask**

![Connect Wallet to Moonbeam Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-1.webp)

If you're not already signed into MetaMask, you will be prompted to sign in. You will then be guided through adding and connecting your accounts, and adding and switching to the Moonbase Alpha network:

 1. Select an account and connect to the Safe. You'll want to select at least 2 of the 3 owner accounts and then click **Next**. For this example, Alice, Bob, and Charlie's accounts have all been selected 
 2. Connect to the selected accounts by clicking **Connect**
 3. If you are not connected to Moonbase Alpha, nor do you have the network added to your MetaMask, add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network by clicking **Approve**
 4. Switch the network to Moonbase Alpha by click **Switch Network**

![Connect MetaMask to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-2.webp)

Now, in the top right hand corner, you can confirm you are connected to your MetaMask account on the Moonbase Alpha network. If you're using the development accounts, you should see Alice's account address. If not, double check your MetaMask and switch to Alice's account.

### Create New Safe {: #create-new-safe }

To create a new Safe on Moonbase Alpha, click **Create new Safe**. You will be taken to a wizard that will walk you through creating your new Safe. By going through these steps and creating your Safe, you are consenting to the terms of use and the privacy policy. So, feel free to look those over before getting started.

![Create Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-3.webp)

You will need to give your Safe a name:

 1. Enter the name of your new Safe, you can use `moonbeam-tutorial`
 2. Click **Start**

![Submit Safe Name](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-4.webp)

Next up is the owners and confirmations section of the wizard. In this section, you will add the owners of the Safe and specify the threshold. The threshold determines how many of the owners are required to confirm a transaction before the transaction gets executed. 

There are many different setups that can be used when creating a Safe. There can be 1 or more owners of the Safe as well as varying threshold levels. Please note that it is not advised to create a Safe with just 1 owner as it creates the possibility of a single point of failure.

For this guide, you will create a multisig setup that has 3 owners and requires a threshold of 2, so at least 2 out of the 3 owners keys are required to execute transactions through the Safe.

Your account will automatically be prefilled in as the first owner, however this can be changed if you would like to use different accounts. For this example, Alice's account has been prefilled. In addition to Alice, you can also add Bob and Charlie as owners:

 1. Click **Add another owner**
 2. Enter **Bob** as the second owner, along with his address: `0x3Cd0A705a2DC65e5b1E1205896BaA2be8A07c6e0`
 3. Enter **Charlie** as the third owner, along with his address: `0x798d4Ba9baf0064Ec19eB4F0a1a45785ae9D6DFc`
 4. Set the confirmation threshold to **2** out of 3 owners
 5. Click **Review** to go to the last step in the wizard

![Enter Safe Owners](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-5.webp)

Finally, you can review all of the Safe and owner details and if everything looks ok:

 1. Click **Submit** to create your new Safe. The creation of the Safe will cost approximately less than .001 DEV tokens on Moonbase Alpha. MetaMask will pop-up and prompt you to confirm the transaction
 2. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction and create the Safe

![Send Transaction to Create Multisig Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-6.webp)

It could take a few minutes to process the transaction and create the Safe, but once it has been created you should see a message saying "Your Safe was created successfully". From there, you can click **Get Started** to load your Safe and start interacting with it.

![Safe Created Successfully](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-7.webp)

## Configure Safe {: #configure-safe }

You can always manage your Safe and change some of the parameters set when creating it. To do so, you can click on the **Settings** option on the left-hand side menu. 

![Modify Safe Settings](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-8.webp)

In there you have the following options:

 - **Safe Details** — allows you to change the Safe name. This is a local action that requires no on-chain interaction
 - **Owners** — allows you to initiate a on-chain proposal to add/remove owners to the Safe
 - **Policies** — allows you to initiate a on-chain proposal to change the multisig threshold to execute the proposal as a transaction
 - **Advanced** — allows you to check other parameters from the Safe, such as the nonce, modules, and transaction guard
 
## Receive and Send Tokens {: #receive-and-send-tokens }

### Receive Tokens {: #receive-tokens }

Now that you have created your Safe, you can start interacting with it. First, load up the Safe by sending some DEV tokens to it. You can send funds to the Safe from any account with DEV tokens. For this example, you can use Alice's account. Hover over **DEV** in the list of assets to reveal the **Send** and **Receive** buttons. Then click **Receive**.

![Receive Tokens to the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-9.webp)

A pop-up will appear with the address of the Safe. Copy the address and click **Done**. 

![Copy Safe Address](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-10.webp)

Next, open up your MetaMask to initiate a transaction:

 1. Click **Send** to send a transaction
 2. Paste in the address of the Safe
 3. Enter the amount of DEV tokens you would like to send to the Safe. For this example, you can use 2 DEV tokens
 4. Click **Next**
 5. Review the details of the transaction and click **Confirm**

![Send DEV Tokens to the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-11.webp)

The transaction will be sent and your balance for DEV tokens will be updated on the Safe. 

### Send Tokens {: #send-tokens }

Now that you have funds in the Safe, you can send funds from the Safe to another account. For this example, you can send 1 DEV token to Bob's address. Hover over **DEV** in the list of assets, and this time click on **Send**.

![Send Tokens from the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-12.webp)

A pop-up will appear where you can enter the recipient and the amount of DEV tokens to send:

 1. Enter Bob's Address
 2. Select **DEV** from the list of assets
 3. Enter 1 DEV token
 4. Click **Review**

![Send 1 DEV Token from the Safe to Bob](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-13.webp)

 1. Review the details and click **Submit**. MetaMask will pop-up and you'll notice that instead of sending a transaction, you're sending a message
 2. Click **Sign** to sign the message

![Submit Transaction and Sign Message](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-14.webp)

Now, if you go back to the Safe, under the **Transactions** tab, you should be able to see that there has been a transaction proposal initiated to send 1 DEV tokens to Bob's address. However, you should also see that only 1 out of 2 confirmations have been received and that 1 more owner is required to confirm the transaction before it gets executed. 

![Transaction Needs Confirmations](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-15.webp)

### Transaction Confirmation {: #transaction-confirmation }

The process of confirming (or rejecting) a transaction proposal is similar for all the use cases of a multisig Safe. One of the owners initiates the proposal to execute an action. The other owners can approve or reject the proposal. Once the signature threshold is reached, any owner can execute the transaction proposal if approved, or discard the transaction proposal if rejected.

In this example, if 2 of the 3 owners decided to reject the proposal, then the assets would remain in the Safe. However, in this case, you can confirm the transaction from either Bob's or Charlie's account.

Switch accounts in MetaMask to Bob's account (or Charlie's). Then go back to the Safe connected as Bob. The **Confirm** button should now be enabled. As Bob, go ahead and click **Confirm** to meet the threshold and send the transaction. A pop-up will appear for you to approve the transaction:

 1. Check the **Execute transaction** box to execute the transaction immediately after confirmation. You can un-check it for the transaction to be executed manually at a later time
 2. Click **Submit**
 3. MetaMask will pop-up and ask you to confirm the transaction, if everything looks good, you can click **Confirm**

!!! note
    If you receive an error stating the transaction might fail, you may need to increase the gas limit. You can do so either in the **Advanced options** or in MetaMask. 

![Submit Transaction Confirmation](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-16.webp)

The transaction will be removed from the **QUEUE** tab and a record of the transaction can now be found under the **HISTORY** tab. In addition, Bob's balance has now increased by 1 DEV token, and the Safe's balance for DEV tokens has decreased.

![Successfully Executed Transaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-17.webp)

Congratulations, you've successfully received and sent DEV tokens to and from the Safe!

## Receive and Send ERC-20 Tokens {: #receive-and-send-erc20-tokens }

### Receive ERC-20 Tokens {: #receive-erc20-tokens }

Next up is to receive and send ERC-20s to and from the Safe. You should already have loaded up your MetaMask with **MYTOK** ERC-20 tokens. If not, please refer back to the [ERC-20 Tokens](#erc20-tokens) section of the prerequisites.

You should still be connected to Bob's account for this example. So, you'll be sending MYTOK tokens from Bob's account to the Safe.

You'll need to get the Safe's address again, you can do so by clicking on the **Copy to clipboard** icon in the top left hand corner. Once you've got your Safe's address copied, open up MetaMask:

 1. Switch to the **Assets** tab and select **MYTOK** from the list
 2. Click **Send** 
 3. Paste in the Safe's address
 4. Enter amount of MYTOKs to send. You should have minted 8M MYTOK tokens in the [Using Remix to Deploy to Moonbeam](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} guide. So for this example, you can enter 1000 MYTOKs for the amount to send
 5. Click **Next**
 6. Review the transaction details and then click **Confirm** to send the transaction.

![Send ERC-20s to the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-18.webp)

If you navigate back to the Safe, in the list of **Assets** you should now see **MyToken** and a balance of 1000 MYTOKs. It could take a few minutes for **MyToken** to appear, but there is nothing for you to do to add the asset, it will appear on it's own.

### Send ERC-20 Tokens {: #send-erc20-tokens }

Now that you have loaded your Safe with MYTOKs, you can send some from the Safe to another account. For this example, you can send 10 MYTOKs to Charlie.  

Hover over **MyToken** in the list of assets, and this time click on **Send**.

![Send ERC-20s from the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-19.webp)

A pop-up will appear where you can enter the recipient and the amount of MYTOK tokens to send:

 1. Enter Charlies's Address
 2. Select **MyToken** from the list of assets
 3. Enter 10 MYTOK tokens
 4. Click **Review** and review the details

![Send ERC-20s to Charlie from the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-20.webp)

If everything looks ok, you can: 

 1. Click **Submit**. MetaMask will pop-up and you'll notice that instead of sending a transaction, you're sending a message
 2. Click **Sign** to sign the message

![Sign Message to Send ERC-20s to Charlie from the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-21.webp)

Now, if you go back to the Safe, under the **Transactions** tab, you should be able to see that there has been a transaction proposal initiated to send 10 MYTOK tokens to Charlie's address. However, you should also see that only 1 out of 2 confirmations have been received and that 1 more owner is required to confirm the transaction before it gets executed.

![Transaction Needs Confirmation](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-22.webp)

You will need to switch accounts to Alice or Charlie and confirm the transaction to execute it. You can follow the same steps outlined in the above [Transaction Confirmation](#transaction-confirmation) section.

Once the transaction has been confirmed from one of the other two accounts, the transaction will be moved to the **HISTORY** tab. 

![Successfully Executed Transaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-23.webp)

Congratulations! You've successfully received and sent ERC-20 tokens to and from the Safe!

## Interact with a Smart Contract {: #interact-with-a-smart-contract }

For this section, you will be interacting with a smart contract using the Safe. You should have already deployed the `SetText.sol` contract using Remix, if not please refer back to the [Deployed Smart Contract](#deployed-smart-contract) section of the prerequisites.

You should still be connected to Alice's account for this section of the guide.

From the Safe:

 1. On the left hand side click on **New Transaction**
 2. Then select **Contract interaction**

![New Contract Interaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-24.webp)

The **Contract interaction** pop-up will appear and you can fill in the contract details:

 1. Enter the contract address into the **Contract address** field
 2. In the **ABI** text box, paste the ABI
 3. A **Method** dropdown will appear. Select the `setTextData` function
 4. Then a `_text` input field will appear. You can enter anything you would like, for this example, you can use `polkadots and moonbeams`
 5. Click **Review**

![Create Contract Interaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-25.webp)

If the details look ok, go ahead and:

 1. Click **Submit**. MetaMask will pop-up and you'll notice that instead of sending a transaction, you're sending a message
 2. Click **Sign** to sign the message

![Submit Contract Interaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-26.webp)

Now, if you go back to the Safe, under the **Transactions** tab, you should be able to see that there has been a transaction proposal initiated for a **Contract interaction**. However, you should also see that only 1 out of 2 confirmations have been received and that 1 more owner is required to confirm the transaction before it gets executed.

![Transaction Needs Confirmation](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-27.webp)

You will need to switch accounts to Bob or Charlie and confirm the transaction to execute it. You can follow the same steps outlined in the above [Transaction Confirmation](#transaction-confirmation) section.

Once the transaction has been confirmed from one of the other two accounts, the transaction will be moved to the **HISTORY** tab.

![Transaction History](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-28.webp)

To double check that the correct text was set, you can go through the process again except instead of selecting **setTextData** from the **Method** dropdown, you can select **text** to read the `text` value. This will be a call instead of a transaction, so a **Call** button will appear. Click on it and directly within the pop-up, you should see the result of the call, `polkadots and moonbeams`.

![Contract Interaction Call Result](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-29.webp)

Congratulations, you've successfully interacted with a smart contract using the Safe!

## Using Moonbeam Safe APIs {: #using-moonbeam-safe-apis }

There are APIs available to read from and interact with Moonbeam Safes for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha.

=== "Moonbeam"

     ```text
     {{networks.moonbeam.multisig.api_page }}
     ```

=== "Moonriver"

     ```text
     {{networks.moonriver.multisig.api_page}}
     ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

     ```text
     {{networks.moonbase.multisig.api_page}}
     ```

As an example of using the API, try retrieving information about Safes from the Moonbeam Safe API. From the Safe page, copy the address of your Safe:
