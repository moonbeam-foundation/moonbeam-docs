# Fiat On-ramp services to acquire GLMR for Moonbeam

## Introduction

Interacting with dApps or deploying smart contracts on Moonbeam requires users to hold GLMR tokens, which are used to pay for network transaction fees (gas) - except in the case of [gasless transactions](/tutorials/eth-api/call-permit-gasless-txs/){target=\_blank}. To help users acquire GLMR, there are several reliable on-ramp services available to convert local currency (fiat) into GLMR. This guide covers two popular options - [Transak](https://transak.com/buy/glmr){target=\_blank} and [Onramp](https://onramp.money/coins/moonbeam.html){target=\_blank} - each offering different payment methods and features to suit individual needs. Supporting bank transfers, credit cards, and mobile payment solutions, these platforms provide secure and regulated ways to acquire GLMR tokens. 

You can find a current list of supported on-ramps on the [Moonbeam dApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam){target=\_blank}. Please be aware that the availability of these services may vary by jurisdiction. For more information, please visit the website of the respective on-ramp. 

## Transak

Using Transak is a straightforward way to purchase GLMR tokens for the Moonbeam network. The process begins at [Transak](https://transak.com/buy/glmr){target=\_blank} with selecting GLMR as the desired cryptocurrency. Users select their local currency and purchase amount, then review the associated fees and processing time details. The next step requires entering the destination Moonbeam wallet address. For bank transfers and other fiat payment methods, a one-time KYC verification process must be completed by providing valid identification documents. After payment completion through the selected method (bank transfer, credit card, or other supported options), Transak processes the transaction and sends the GLMR tokens directly to the specified wallet address. Delivery time varies depending on the payment method selected, ranging from near-instant for card payments to up to 2 business days for bank transfers.

## Onramp

[Onramp](https://onramp.money/coins/moonbeam.html){target=\_blank} offers a seamless fiat-to-crypto gateway for purchasing GLMR tokens, supporting over 400 different cryptocurrencies through their platform. The process begins with a straightforward phone-based OTP login system for verification. After login, the platform displays transaction details, including the GLMR amount and current market rates, for confirmation. Based on geographical location, Onramp displays relevant bank account details and available payment methods. Once payment is completed through the selected method, Onramp handles all aspects of the conversion - from payment processing to regulatory compliance and wallet management. Upon confirmation of the deposit, the platform automatically purchases GLMR at the current market price and then initiates an automatic withdrawal to the specified Moonbeam wallet address. Additional KYC verification may be required for larger transactions, but the platform manages all compliance requirements internally to ensure a smooth experience.
