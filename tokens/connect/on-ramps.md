# Onboarding to Moonbeam with On-Ramps

## Introduction

Interacting with dApps or deploying smart contracts on Moonbeam requires users to hold GLMR tokens, which are used to pay for network transaction fees (gas) - except in the case of [gasless transactions](/tutorials/eth-api/call-permit-gasless-txs/){target=\_blank}. To help users acquire GLMR, there are several reliable on-ramp services available to convert local currency (fiat) into GLMR. This guide covers three popular options - [Transak](https://transak.com/buy/glmr){target=\_blank}, [Onramp](https://onramp.money/coins/moonbeam.html){target=\_blank} , and [Guardarian](https://guardarian.com/buy-glmr){target=\_blank} - each offering different payment methods and features to suit individual needs. Supporting bank transfers, credit cards, and mobile payment solutions, these platforms provide secure and regulated ways to acquire GLMR tokens. 

Please be aware that availability of these services may vary by jurisdiction. Please visit the website of the respective on-ramp for more information. 

## Transak

Using Transak is a straightforward way to purchase GLMR tokens for the Moonbeam network. The process begins at [Transak](https://transak.com/buy/glmr){target=\_blank} with selecting GLMR as the desired cryptocurrency. Users select their local currency and purchase amount, then review the associated fees and processing time details. The next step requires entering the destination Moonbeam wallet address. For bank transfers and other fiat payment methods, a one-time KYC verification process must be completed by providing valid identification documents. After payment completion through the selected method (bank transfer, credit card, or other supported options), Transak processes the transaction and sends the GLMR tokens directly to the specified wallet address. Delivery time varies depending on the payment method selected, ranging from near-instant for card payments to up to 2 business days for bank transfers.

Based on geographical location, Onramp displays relevant bank account details and available payment methods. Once payment is completed through the selected method, Onramp handles all aspects of the conversion - from payment processing to regulatory compliance and wallet management. The platform automatically purchases GLMR at the current market price upon confirming the deposit, then initiates an automatic withdrawal to the specified Moonbeam wallet address.
