# Interacting with Moonbeam Using MetaMask

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers can leverage Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility features to integrate tools, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, into their dApps. By doing so, they can use the injected library MetaMask provides to interact with the blockchain.

Currently, MetaMask can be configured to connect to a few networks: Moonbeam, Moonriver, the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, and a Moonbeam development node.

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to the network of your choice:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbeam">Connect to Moonbeam</a>
</div>

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonriver">Connect to Moonriver</a>
</div>

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbase">Connect to Moonbase Alpha</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will pop up asking for permission to add a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network.

Learn [how to integrate a Connect MetaMask button](/builders/integrations/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank} into your dApp, so that users can connect to Moonbase Alpha with a simple click of a button. The guide can also be adapted for the other Moonbeam-based networks.

## Install the MetaMask Extension {: #install-the-metamask-extension }

First, you'll start with a fresh and default [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank} installation from the Chrome store. After downloading, installing, and initializing the extension, follow the **Get Started** guide. In there, you need to create a wallet, set a password, and store your secret backup phrase (this gives direct access to your funds, so make sure to store these in a secure place).

## Setup a Wallet {: #setup-a-wallet }

After installing [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, the setup will automatically open a new task with a welcome screen. Here, you are offered two options:

- **Create a new wallet** - you'll go through some steps to get a new seed phrase. Ensure you store this phrase securely and you don't share it publicly
- **Import an existing wallet** - you already have a seed phrase stored, and you want to restore an account from that recovery phrase

![Metamask Setup Interface](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-1.webp)

Once you've selected the option that fits your needs, follow the steps, and you should be all set.

!!! note
    Multiple accounts can be derived from a seed phrase by changing what is known as the address index. By default, when creating or importing an account from the seed phrase, you get the account with the address index 0. You can get the other indexes by just adding new accounts in the main Metamask screen.

## Import Accounts {: #import-accounts }

Once you've created a wallet or imported an existing one, you can also import any account into MetaMask if you hold the private keys.

For this example, you'll use private keys from the development account. Click the account switcher button to import an account using its private keys. That is where it says **Account 1**.

![Importing account from private key metamask menu](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-2.webp)

Next, click on **Import Account**.

![Importing account from private key account switcher menu](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-3.webp)

Finally, enter the private keys of the account you are trying to import. For example, you can use one of the accounts prefunded in the Moonbeam development node. This guide uses Gerald's key. Once you've entered the private key, click on **Import**.

![Paste your account key into MetaMask](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-4.webp)

You should end up with an imported **Account 2** that looks like this:

## Interact with the Network {: #interact-with-the-network }

Once you've [connected Metamask](#connect-metamask-to-moonbeam) to any Moonbeam-based network, you can start using your wallet by:

- Sending a token transfer to another address
- Adding ERC-20s to Metamask and interacting with them
- Adding ERC-721s to Metamask and interacting with them

### Initiate a Transfer { #initiate-a-transfer }

This section showcases how to do a simple token transfer to another address as an example of using Metamask with Moonbeam.

To do so, take the following steps:

1. Ensure you are connected to the correct network
2. Ensure you have selected the account you want to use for the transfer
3. On the main screen of your Metamask wallet, click on **Send**

![Initiate balance transfer in Metamask](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-10.webp)

Next, you can enter the address to which you want to send the tokens. For this example, a wallet that has already been imported to Metamask is selected, known as **Bob**.

![Select account to send tokens to in Metamask](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-11.webp)

On the next screen, take the following steps:

1. Enter the number of tokens you want to send
2. Verify that all the information is correct, and click on **Next**

![Set the amount of tokens to send in Metamask](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-12.webp)

Lastly, confirm that all the gas-related parameters and fees are correct. After you've verified that everything is OK, click **Confirm**. At this point, your transaction has been sent to the network!

![Confirming a transaction in Metamask](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-13.webp)

Once you've confirmed your transaction, you are taken back to the main screen of your wallet, where you'll see the transaction as **Pending**. After less than a minute, the transaction should be **Confirmed**. If you click on your transaction, you can check more details and view it in a block explorer.
