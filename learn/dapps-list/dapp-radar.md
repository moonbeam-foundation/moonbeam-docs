# How to List your Project on DappRadar

## Introduction to DappRadar {: #introduction-to-dappradar }

[DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/){target=\_blank} was started in 2018 with the goal of delivering high quality, accurate insights on decentralized applications to the world. Since then, DappRadar has become a defacto standard for DApp discovery with nearly ten thousand applications listed across twenty protocols. In their own words, *“DappRadar filters through dapp data, removes fake and irrelevant activity and provides actionable market intelligence. Dapps are tracked in terms of their active users, token volume and transaction activity to provide insight into the trends in the dapp ecosystem.”*

Moonbeam and Moonriver are [now live on DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/blog/dappradar-now-tracking-dapps-on-moonbeam-moonriver){target=\_blank}. DappRadar maintains homepages for [the top Moonbeam DApps](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/moonbeam){target=\_blank} and [the top Moonriver DApps](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/moonriver){target=\_blank}. Prior to the DappRadar integration, a [crowd-sourced Moonbeam DApps listing](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam-project-directory){target=\_blank} was maintained as part of the Moonbeam docs site. That registry is deprecated and replaced by the listing platforms under the [Dapps List](/learn/dapps-list/){target=\_blank} section
