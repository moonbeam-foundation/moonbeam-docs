# How to List your Project on Downtown Moonbeam

![Downtown Moonbeam banner image](/images/learn/dapps-list/dtmb/dtmb-banner.png)

## Introduction to Downtown Moonbeam

[Downtown Moonbeam](https://www.dtmb.xyz/){target=_blank} provides a curated list of projects building specifically within the Moonbeam and Moonriver ecosystems. It provides basic information for each DApp such as website information, a brief description, and contact information.

You can filter DApps by network, or check out their homepage to see a list of the newly updated DApps, top defi projects, top NFT projects, or top gaming projects. Prior to the Downtown Moonbeam integration, a [crowd-sourced Moonbeam DApps listing](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam-project-directory){target=_blank} was maintained as part of the Moonbeam docs site. That registry is deprecated and replaced by the listing platforms under the [Dapps List](/learn/dapps-list/){target=_blank} section.

Only a subset of the fields are required, but you are encouraged to complete as many as possible.
