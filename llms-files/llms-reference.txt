# Glossary

There's a great deal of terminology that's specific to Polkadot, Substrate, and the emerging Parity/Web3 ecosystem. We've compiled a list of terms we think you'll want to know as you review the Moonbeam documentation, plans, and tutorials.

### Collators {: #collators }

One of the key network participants needed to support parachains within the Polkadot Network. In Moonbeam, collators are the nodes that are responsible for block production and for submitting produced blocks up to the Polkadot relay chain for finalization.

### Delegators {: #delegators }

Moonbeam token holders who stake tokens, vouching for specific collator candidates on the parachain. Any user that holds a minimum amount of tokens as [free balance](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-accounts/#balance-types#balance-types){target=\_blank} can become a delegator by staking their tokens.

### Nominators {: #nominators }

Relay chain token holders who select to "back" a validator. They can receive part of the validator's reward, but are subject to slashing of their staked tokens in case the validator misbehaves. A nominator can back up to 16 validators, and their bond is fully distributed between the backed validators that were selected for the validator set.

### Nominated Proof of Stake {: #nominated-proof-of-stake }

The mechanism used by Polkadot for selecting its block validator set to maximize chain security. At its core, it is a Proof-of-Stake system (PoS) in which nominators back validators. The latter with the highest backing are selected to be part of the validator set for a session. The stake of a validator is slashed in case of misbehavior. Thus, nominators are expected to do due diligence on the validators they nominate.

### Parachains {: #parachains }

A blockchain which has a slot and is connected to Polkadot. Parachains receive shared security from Polkadot and the ability to interact with other parachains on the Polkadot network. They must lock DOT, the native relay chain token, to secure a slot for a specific period (up two years).

### Parathreads {: #parathreads }

A blockchain which can connect to Polkadot. Parathreads are able to interact with other members of the Polkadot network, but they bid for block finalization (in DOT) on a block-to-block basis. They compete with other parathreads for block finalization, meaning that the block with the highest bid is selected to be finalize in that round.

### Polkadot {: #polkadot }

A network of connected blockchains that provides shared security and the ability to interact between chains. Polkadot is built using the Substrate development framework. Chains that connect to Polkadot are called parachains.

### Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

The backbone blockchain supporting the Polkadot network. Parachains connect to the relay chain and use it for shared security and message passing. Validators on the relay chain help secure the parachains.

### Smart Contract {: #smart-contract }

A [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract){target=\_blank} is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control, or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. Smart contracts intend to reduce the need for trusted intermediators, arbitrations, and enforcement costs, as well as reduce fraud losses and malicious and accidental exceptions.

### Substrate {: #substrate }

A Rust-based blockchain development framework created by Parity Technologies based on their experience implementing multiple blockchain clients. Substrate comes with many modules and functionalities that are needed when building a blockchain, including P2P networking, consensus mechanisms, staking, cryptocurrency, on-chain governance modules, and more. It dramatically reduces the time and engineering effort required to implement a blockchain. Substrate is now part of the [Polkadot SDK](https://polkadot.com/platform/sdk/){target=\_blank}.

### Substrate Frame Pallets {: #substrate-frame-pallets }

Substrate Frame Pallets are a collection of Rust-based modules, providing the functionality required for building a blockchain.

### Validators {: #validators }

A node that secures the Polkadot relay chain by staking DOT in the network, which is slashed if they misbehave. They finalize blocks from collators on parachains and also participate on consensus for the next relay chain block with other validators.

### WebAssembly/Wasm {: #webassemblywasm }

WebAssembly is an open standard that defines a portable binary code format. It is supported by different programming languages, compilers, and browsers.

# How to List your Project on the Moonbeam DApp Directory

## Introduction to the Moonbeam DApp Directory {: #introduction-to-state-of-the-dapps }

The Moonbeam ecosystem comprises two distinct production networks: Moonbeam and Moonriver. Each network has its own dedicated DApp Directory, maintained by the Moonbeam Foundation: [Moonbeam](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam/app-dir){target=\_blank} and [Moonriver](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonriver/app-dir){target=\_blank}. These directories categorize projects spanning from DeFi to NFTs to gaming, providing users with comprehensive access to diverse applications.

You'll supply core project details like name, description, and relevant links when adding your project. Depending on your project type, you may include additional data such as on-chain stats and token information.

Despite the distinction between the Moonbeam and Moonriver DApp directories, the submission process remains the same. To list your project on the DApp Directory, you must submit a pull request to the [Moonbeam Foundation's App Directory Data repository on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank}. This guide outlines the necessary data and formatting specifics for your submission.

![The Moonbeam DApp Directory home page](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-1.webp)

## Overview of the Project Data {: #overview-project-data }

There are four main sources of data that are used for a project's listing in the Moonbeam DApp Directory:

- **Core project data**: Core project data such as descriptions, logos, and screenshots. This data also includes IDs used to query data from external platforms.
- **Active users and transaction volume**: On-chain data based on smart contract activity for all of the contracts associated with the project. Data is discovered via the use of contract labeling in Moonscan and is indexed and consumed by the DApp Directory.
- **TVL data**: TVL data for the protocol, sourced from the project's listing on DefiLlama.
- **Project token information**: Token information, which is sourced from the project's listing on CoinGecko.

## Prerequisites for Using External Data Sources {: #configuring-external-data-sources }

Before pulling data from the mentioned sources, certain prerequisites must be fulfilled. However, it's worth noting that these steps may not apply to all project types. For instance, in the case of wallets, where there are no smart contracts, the DApp Directory is currently unable to display user and transaction activity data.

### Configure the Data Source for Active Users and Transaction Volume {: #configure-active-users }

For projects that have smart contracts deployed on Moonbeam or Moonriver, it is important that those contracts can be linked to the DApp Directory project data.

The end-to-end flow for linking smart contract activity to the DApp Directory is as follows:

1. The smart contract owner fills in the [form to label contracts on Moonscan](https://moonscan.io/contactus?id=5){target=\_blank}.
2. The contracts become labeled in Moonscan.
3. Labeled contracts can then be ingested by ecosystem analytics providers to index activity for your project.
4. (Recommended) Register your project with FiDi so your activity can be indexed and publicly viewable. See the FiDi registration section below.

To get your project's smart contracts properly labeled on [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank}, submit the [Moonscan contract labeling form](https://moonscan.io/contactus?id=5){target=\_blank} with your project and contract details.

### Register with FiDi for Analytics (Recommended) {: #register-with-fidi }

New and existing projects are encouraged to register with FiDi so your project's activity can be indexed and surfaced in public analytics. Submit your project using the [FiDi Project Listing Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8c5iOzwIHhLJKRTnC48j7CAj9JY8i_lHxryNBdJdzIyDx3Q/viewform){target=\_blank}.

After submission, Moonbeam FiDi analytics can be viewed on the [Moonbeam FiDi Dashboard](https://moonbeam.fidi.tech/dashboard/moonbeam){target=\_blank}.

Required Project Information:

Where possible, include a short purpose description for each contract to improve completeness.

- **Core smart contracts**: Addresses of main contracts that define core functionality and interact significantly with the network. Optionally, include a brief description of each contract's purpose.
- **Factory contracts**: If applicable, addresses of any contracts that deploy other contracts as part of your dApp. Please also provide the creation topic (hash of the creation event) for each factory contract.
- **Deployer wallets**: If applicable, addresses of wallets used to deploy your project's contracts.

Additional Project-Specific Information (Optional):

- **Treasury/Admin wallets**: Addresses of wallets with administrative control or funds. Optionally, include a brief description of each wallet's function.
- **Oracle contracts**: Addresses of any oracle contracts. Optionally, include a brief description of what data these oracles provide.
- **Bridge contracts**: Addresses of any bridge contracts and the list of connected chains.
- **Governance contracts**: Addresses of any contracts related to on-chain governance. Optionally, include a brief explanation of your governance model.

Additional considerations:

- If your project batches transactions, consider using the Batch Precompile.
- Factory contracts should derive from or mimic the standard Uniswap factory.
- Diamond (multi-facet proxy) contracts are supported and will be indexed correctly.
- Typical listing time is 1–2 weeks; FiDi may reach out for clarifications.

Once you've labeled your smart contracts and are ready to submit your project to the DApp Directory, configuring the Directory to utilize your smart contract data becomes straightforward. You'll only need the **Project** component of your labeled contracts.

Consider the following example project with two smart contracts: a Comptroller and a Router recently updated to a new version.

|  Project   | Contract Name | Contract Version |      Resulting Label       |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------------:|
| My Project |  Comptroller  |        V1        | My Project: Comptroller V1 |
| My Project |    Router     |        V2        |   My Project: Router V2    |

To submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, ensure you have your **Project** name ready, identified here as `My Project`.

If you're ready to add your project to the DApp Directory, skip to the [How to Submit Your Project Listing](#how-to-submit-your-project-listing) section.

### Configure the Data Source for TVL {: #configure-tvl }

If the project represents a DeFi protocol with TVL (whereby value is locked in the protocol's smart contract), it is possible to display TVL in the Moonbeam DApp Directory.

TVL data is pulled from [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com){target=\_blank}, so you must list your project there. To get your project listed, please refer to DefiLlama's documentation on [How to list a DeFi project](https://docs.llama.fi/list-your-project/submit-a-project){target=\_blank}.

After listing your project, you can easily configure the DApp Directory to pull data from DefiLlama. To do so, you'll need the DefiLlama identifier, which you can find in the URL for your protocol's page. For example, the URL for Moonwell's page is `https://defillama.com/protocol/moonwell`, so the identifier is `moonwell`.

If you have the identifier and are ready to submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, skip to the [How to Submit Your Project Listing](#how-to-submit-your-project-listing) section.

### Configure the Data Source for Project Token Information {: #project-token-information }

If a project has a token, it is possible to display the name of the token, current price, and contract in the DApp Directory.

However, the data is pulled from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com){target=\_blank}, so the project's token must be listed there. If your token is not listed there, you can complete [CoinGecko's Request Form](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/requests/new){target=\_blank} to initiate the listing process.

Assuming your project's token is listed there, you must obtain the CoinGecko **API ID** value. You can find the **API ID** value in the **Information** section of the token's page on CoinGecko. For example, the **API ID** on [Moonwell's token page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonwell){target=\_blank} is `moonwell-artemis`.

If you have the CoinGecko ID and are ready to submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, you can continue to the next section.

## How to Submit Your Project Listing {: #how-to-submit-your-project-listing }

As mentioned, you must submit a pull request to the Moonbeam Foundation's GitHub repository that holds the DApp Directory's data. Before getting started, it's worth noting that to expedite the review process, the GitHub user who submits the pull request is recommended to be a major contributor to the project's GitHub so that the Moonbeam Foundation can quickly verify that they represent the project. You can check out the [Review Process](#review-process) section for more information.

To begin, you have two options for adding your project information to the [`app-directory-data` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank}. You can utilize [GitHub's browser-based editor](https://github.dev/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank}, which offers a user-friendly interface.

![The app-directory-data repository loaded on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-2.webp)

Or you can clone the repository locally and make modifications using your preferred code editor, in which you can use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data.git
```

Once you've cloned the project, you can create a new branch to which you will add all of your changes. To do this on the browser-based editor, take the following steps:

1. Click on the current branch name in the bottom left corner.
2. A menu will appear at the top of the page. Enter the name of your branch.
3. Click **Create new branch...**.

![Create a new branch on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-3.webp)

The page will reload, and your branch name will now be displayed in the bottom left corner.

### Projects with Deployments on Moonbeam and Moonriver {: #projects-with-deployments }

If a project is deployed to both Moonbeam and Moonriver, there are two different options available:

- Create a separate project structure for each deployment.
- Use a single project structure and modify the project data file for both projects.

Separate project structures should be used if:

- The two deployments have distinct representations in DefiLlama (i.e., two distinct identifiers).
- The project has two different tokens, one native to Moonbeam and one native to Moonriver.

Otherwise, either option may be used.

### Set Up the Folder Structure for Your Project {: #set-up-the-file-structure }

All configurations for each project listed in the DApp Directory are stored in the `projects` folder.

To get started, you must have a name that uniquely and properly identifies your project. Using your project name, you can take the following steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project using your unique project name.
2. In your project directory, you'll need to create:
    1. A project data file is a JSON file that defines all your project data and contains references to the images stored in the `logos` and `screenshots` folders. The list of fields you can use to define your data, with descriptions, is outlined in the next section. The file must be named using your unique project name.
    2. A `logos` folder where your project logo images are stored.
    3. (Optional) A `screenshots` folder where screenshots for the project are stored.

??? code "Example folder structure"

    ```text
    my-project
├── my-project.json
├── logos
│   ├── my-project-logo-small.jpeg
│   └── my-project-logo-full.jpeg
└── screenshots
    ├── my-project-screenshot1-small.jpeg
    ├── my-project-screenshot1-full.jpeg
    ├── my-project-screenshot2-small.jpeg
    └── my-project-screenshot2-full.jpeg
    ```

![The file structure displayed on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-4.webp)

With the foundational file structure in place, you're ready to populate the necessary information for your project submission.

### Add Information to the Project Data File {: #add-information }

Your project's data file is where you'll add all the information for your project. The file permits the following top-level properties:

| <div style="width:10vw">Property</div> |                         Type                          |                                                                                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:--------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                  `id`                  |                        String                         |                                                                                               Unique identifier for the dApp in the Moonbeam DApp Directory. It should be a unique, human-readable string representing this project. E.g., `my-project`                                                                                                |
|                 `slug`                 |                        String                         |                                                  Identifier used in certain third-party sources. In particular, if the project is listed in DefiLlama, this value should be set to the DefiLlama identifier. See the [Configure the Data Source for TVL](#configure-tvl) section for more information                                                  |
|                 `name`                 |                        String                         |                                                                                                                                      The project name as it will appear in the DApp Directory. E.g., `My Project`                                                                                                                                      |

A project can only have one category, and it corresponds to the category list in the left-hand nav of the DApp Directory. See the [Category and Tags](#category-and-tags) section for the accepted list of values                                          |
|             `coinGeckoId`              |                        String                         |                                              If the project has a token listed on CoinGecko, this property should have the **API ID** value corresponding to the given token. See the [Configure the Data Source for Project Token Information](#project-token-information) section for more information                                               |

#### URLs {: #urls }

The `urls` property name/value pairs are used so a project can provide links to their website, socials, etc.

The following table lists the supported `urls` properties:

| Property Name |                                                    Description                                                     |                     Example                     |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|
|   `website`   |                                          The main website for the project                                          |            https://moonbeam.network/            |
|     `try`     | URL a user should visit if they want to try out the dApp. Typically, this page will have a link to launch the dApp |            https://moonbeam.network/            |
|   `twitter`   |                                     The project's X (Twitter) profile                                      |       https://x.com/MoonbeamNetwork       |
|   `medium`    |                                             The project's Medium site                                              |       https://medium.com/moonbeam-network       |
|  `telegram`   |                                               The project's Telegram                                               |         https://t.me/Moonbeam_Official          |
|   `github`    |                                          The project's GitHub repository                                           | https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam |
|   `discord`   |                                               The project's Discord                                                |       https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX        |

The format of the property name/value pairs should follow the JSON standard, for example:

```json
"urls": {
    "website": "https://moonbeam.network/",
    "try": "https://docs.moonbeam.network/",
    "twitter": "https://x.com/MoonbeamNetwork"
}
```

#### Logos {: #logos }

The `logos` property of the main project data file is a map of image sizes (i.e., `small`, `large`, `full`) to corresponding image JSON objects. The image JSON object contains the display properties for the given image.

The following table lists the properties of the image JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                                                       Description                                                                        |
|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `fileName` | String |                                         The name of the image file (unqualified) stored in the `logos` directory                                         |
|  `width`   |  int   |                                                          The width of the logo image in pixels                                                           |
|  `height`  |  int   |                                                          The height of the logo image in pixels                                                          |
| `mimeType` | String | The standard [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types){target=\_blank} of the file. E.g., `"image/jpeg"` |

Currently, only the `small` size is utilized, and the dimensions for small logos should be 40x40 pixels.

Here is an example showing the structure of the `logo` property that supplies `small` and `full` logos:

```json
"logo": {
    "small": {
        "fileName": "my-project-logo-small.jpeg",
        "width": 40,
        "height": 40,
        "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
    },
    "full": {
        "fileName": "my-project-logo-full.jpeg",
        "width": 3000,
        "height": 3000,
        "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
    }
}
```

#### Screenshots {: #screenshots }

The `screenshots` property of the main project data file is an array of maps. Each map in the array is for a specific screenshot.

However, different-sized images for each screenshot should be supplied so that different sizes can be used in different contexts (e.g., thumbnails vs full-sized images). Thus, for each screenshot, there is a map of image sizes (i.e., `small`, `large`, `full`) to corresponding image JSON objects. The image JSON object contains the display properties for the given image.

The following table lists the properties of the image JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                                                       Description                                                                        |
|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `fileName` | String |                                      The name of the image file (unqualified) stored in the `screenshots` directory                                      |
|  `width`   |  int   |                                                          The width of the logo image in pixels                                                           |
|  `height`  |  int   |                                                          The height of the logo image in pixels                                                          |
| `mimeType` | String | The standard [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types){target=\_blank} of the file. E.g., `"image/jpeg"` |

Here is an example showing the structure of the `screenshot` property for two screenshots (`screenshot1` and `screenshot2`):

```json
"screenshots": [
    {
        "small": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot1-small.png",
            "width": 429,
            "height": 200,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        },
        "full": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot1-full.png",
            "width": 514,
            "height": 300,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        }
    },
    {
        "small": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot2-small.png",
            "width": 429,
            "height": 200,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        },
        "full": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot2-full.png",
            "width": 1716,
            "height": 800,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        }
    }
]
```

#### Contracts {: #contracts }

A list of contracts for the project. Currently, this is used only for token contracts.

The smart contracts that make up the protocol are sourced from [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank} based on tagging, so they do not need to be listed here. If you have not properly labeled your contracts or are unsure if they are labeled according to the Moonbeam community standard, please refer to the [Configure the Data Source for Active Users and Transaction Volume](#configure-active-users) section.

The following table lists the properties found in the contract JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                  Description                                  |
|:----------:|:------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `contract` | String |                      The address for the smart contract                       |
|  `chain`   | String | The chain on which the contract is deployed (i.e., `moonbeam` or `moonriver`) |
|   `name`   | String |                           The name of the contract                            |

Here is a `contracts` array with a single smart contract for the WGLMR token:

```json
"contracts": [
    {
        "contract": "0xAcc15dC74880C9944775448304B263D191c6077F",
        "chain": "moonbeam",
        "name": "Wrapped GLMR Token"
    }
]
```

### The Review Process {: #review-process }

Submitted pull requests will be reviewed bi-weekly by the Moonbeam Foundation. During the review, and especially for new projects, the Foundation may have to verify that the GitHub user who created the pull request is a contributor and/or represents the specific project. One way projects can expedite this process is if the submitter's GitHub account is also a major contributor to the project itself on GitHub. Alternatively, teams should leave a note in the pull request comments indicating how we can get in touch with project team members to verify.

A comment will be added to the pull request if any changes are requested. After your pull request has been approved, it will be merged, and your project will be added to the Moonbeam DApp Directory!

## How to Update Your Project Listing {: #how-to-update-your-project-listing }

As your project evolves, you may need to update your project's listing or images related to your listing. You can create a new branch for your changes, find and modify your existing project's data from the root `projects` directory, and make the desired changes.

If you are no longer using a logo or screenshot, please remember to remove it from the `logos` or `screenshots` directory.

Once your changes have been made, you must follow the same instructions in the [Submit a Pull Request](#submit-a-pull-request) section so the changes can be [reviewed](#review-process) by the Moonbeam Foundation. Please note that pull requests are reviewed on a bi-weekly basis, so if the update is urgent, you can create a [forum post](https://forum.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} asking for assistance.

## DApp Directory API {: #dapp-directory-api }

The DApp Directory also features a queryable API that you can use to integrate data from Moonbeam's DApp Directory into your application. The API is public and currently does not require authentication. The base URL for the API is as follows:

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/
```

### Query a Project {: #query-a-project}

You can retrieve all the information for a particular project by appending `/projects/INSERT_PROJECT_NAME` to the base URL. If you need clarification on the project name, you can omit the project name as shown below to retrieve data for every listed project and find the project in the response. 

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects
```

Here's an example of querying the API for StellaSwap, which returns the project description, social media information, user counts, relevant smart contract addresses, market data, images, and more. 

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects/stellaswap
```

You can visit the query URL directory in the browser, using a tool like Postman, or directly from the command line with Curl as follows: 

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET 'https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects/stellaswap'
```

This manifests itself in the diverse product suite of StellaSwap that will be explained in more details.

# Historical Updates

## Introduction {: #introduction }

This page overviews historical updates on Moonbeam and Moonriver, such as bug fixes to the Moonbeam source code and data migrations applied.

This page aims to provide information about unexpected behaviors or data inconsistencies associated with updates that require forced data migrations.

## Bugs {: #bugs }

#### Invalid Transactions Stored {: #invalid-transactions-stored }

For invalid transactions where the transaction cost couldn't be paid, the EVM pallet inserted the transaction metadata into storage instead of discarding it because there was no transaction cost validation. As a result, the runtime storage was unnecessarily bloated with invalid transaction data.

This bug only impacted Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----:|:--------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT600 |      0 - 455106      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT600 |      0 - 675175      |

For more information, you can review the [relative Frontier PR on GitHub](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/pull/465){target=\_blank}.

#### Ethereum Fees Weren't Sent to Treasury {: #ethereum-fees-to-treasury }

The Moonbeam transaction fee model before Runtime 3401 and the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank} mandated a 20% allocation of fees sent to the on-chain Treasury and 80% burned as a deflationary force. However, before runtime 800, Ethereum transactions did not correctly allocate 20% of the transaction fees to the on-chain Treasury.

This bug only impacted Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----:|:--------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT800 |      0 - 684728      |

#### Missing Refunds {: #missing-refunds }

Moonbeam is configured to set the existential deposit to 0, meaning that accounts do not need a minimum balance to be considered active. For Substrate-based chains with this configuration, some refunds were missing from zeroed accounts because the account was interpreted as not existing.

#### Incorrect Collator Selection {: #incorrect-collator-selection }

The total delegations for collator candidates were not correctly updated when a delegation was increased via the `delegatorBondMore` extrinsic. This led to issues where the increased delegation amount wasn't included in the candidates' total amount bonded, which is used to determine which candidates are in the active set of collators. As a result, some candidates may not have been selected to be in the active set when they should have been, impacting their own and their delegators' rewards.

#### New Account Event Bug {: #new-account-event }

The `System.NewAccount` event is emitted when a new account is created. However, a bug prevented this event from being emitted for some accounts at creation time. A hotfix was applied that patched the impacted accounts and emitted the `System.NewAccount` at a later time.

The hotfix was applied in the following block ranges:

#### Incorrect Timestamp Units {: #incorrect-timestamp-units }

EIP-2612 and Ethereum blocks deal with timestamps in seconds; however, the Substrate timestamp pallet that Moonbeam implements uses milliseconds. This only affected the EIP-2612 implementation, not the `block.timestamp` value.

#### Substrate Tips Missing Treasury Distribution {: #substrate-tips }

Tips for Substrate-based transactions weren't handled properly. The entire portion of the tip was burned because it was not handled in the runtime code. A fix was applied so that 20% was paid to the Treasury and 80% was burned, consistent with all other fee behavior at that time.

Note that RT3401 introduced a parameters pallet fee configuration allowing governance to adjust how fees are split between the Treasury and burning. After this runtime upgrade combined with the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank}, 100% of all transaction fees on both Moonbeam and Moonriver are now burned.

#### Incorrect Delegation Reward Calculation {: #incorrect-delegation-reward-calculation }

The reward payouts for all delegations and collators were underestimated whenever there were pending requests. Delegation rewards are calculated based on the amount of tokens bonded by each delegator with respect to the total stake of the given collator. By counting delegation amounts for pending requests, the rewards to collators and their delegations were less than they should have been.

#### Block Parent Hash Calculated Incorrectly {: #block-parent-hash-calculated-incorrectly }

After EIP-1559 support was introduced, which included the transition to new Ethereum transaction types, the block header parent hash was miscalculated to `H256::default`.

This bug only impacted Moonbase Alpha and only impacted the following block:

|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------:|
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1200   | RT1201 |    1648995     |

While the root issue was fixed in RT1201, the incorrect hash was corrected in RT2601.

#### Incorrect Handling of EIP-1559 Gas Fees {: #incorrect-gas-fees-eip1559 }

With the introduction of EIP-1559 support, the logic for handling `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` was implemented incorrectly. As a result, the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` was added to the `baseFee` even if the total amount was over the `maxFeePerGas`.

#### Transaction Fees Paid to Collators {: #transaction-fees-paid-to-collators }

For blocks that included EIP-1559 transactions where a priority fee was applied, the transaction fees were incorrectly calculated and distributed to the block's collator. The fee model on Moonbeam for transactions and smart contract execution was previously handled so that 20% of the fees went to the on-chain Treasury and 80% were burned as a deflationary force. Due to this bug, the transaction fees of the impacted transactions were not burned as expected.

Note that RT3401 introduced a parameters pallet fee configuration allowing governance to adjust how fees are split between the Treasury and burning. After this runtime upgrade combined with the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank}, 100% of all transaction fees on both Moonbeam and Moonriver are now burned.

#### Ethereum Transactions Duplicated in Storage {: #ethereum-transactions-duplicated-in-storage }

An upstream bug was introduced to Frontier in the Ethereum Pallet, causing pending transactions that existed during a runtime upgrade to be duplicated in storage across two different blocks. This only impacted the first two blocks after the runtime upgrade in which this bug was introduced.

Only Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha were impacted. The bug was introduced in the following runtimes and affected the following blocks:

|    Network     | Introduced |   Impacted Blocks   |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |   RT1605   | 2077599 and 2077600 |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1603   | 2285347 and 2285348 |

The following transactions were duplicated:

#### Gas Limit Too High for Non-Transactional Calls {: #gas-limit-too-high-for-non-transactional-calls }

When a non-transactional call, such as `eth_call` or `eth_estimateGas`, is made without specifying a gas limit for a past block, the client defaults to using the gas limit multiplier (10x), which causes the gas limit validation to fail as it is validating against an upper bound of the block gas limit. So, if the gas limit is greater than the block gas limit for a given call, a gas limit too high error is returned.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

#### Remote EVM Calls Return Identical Transaction Hashes {: #remote-evm-calls-return-identical-tx-hashes }

When multiple remote EVM calls were sent from different accounts with the same transaction payload and nonce, the same transaction hash was returned for each call. This was possible because remote EVM calls are executed from a keyless account, so if the senders all had the same nonce and were sending the same transaction object, there was no differentiation in the calculation of the transaction hash. This was fixed by adding a global nonce to the Ethereum XCM Pallet, which is the pallet that makes remote EVM calls possible.

#### Gas Estimation Discrepancy {: #gas-estimation-discrepancy }

There was a difference between estimating the gas for a transaction using a non-transaction call, such as `eth_call`, and the execution of it on-chain. The discrepancy occurred because the non-transactional calls were not properly accounting for `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, as such, the ([Proof of Validity](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/glossary/#proof-of-validity){target=\_blank}) consumed by the Ethereum transaction was counted differently. This was fixed by properly accounting for these fields when estimating the size of the on-chain transaction.

#### Incorrect Effective Gas Price In Transaction Receipts {: #incorrect-effective-gas-price }

The `effectiveGasPrice` value returned by `eth_getTransactionReceipt` was different from the on-chain value due to an incorrect calculation of the base fee. Specifically, the transaction receipt's value was computed using the `NextFeeMultiplier` from the block in which the transaction was included rather than the previous block, which is the correct source for computing the base fee.

#### Skipped Ethereum Transaction Traces {: #skipped-ethereum-transaction-traces }

Runtimes with the `evm-tracing` feature enabled introduced additional `ref_time` overhead due to special logic that traces Ethereum transactions (emitting events for each component: gasometer, runtime, EVM) used to fill information for RPC calls like `debug_traceTransaction` and `trace_filter`. 

Since the real `ref_time` in production runtimes is smaller, this could cause the block weight limits to be reached when replaying a block in an EVM-tracing runtime, resulting in skipped transaction traces. This was observed in Moonbeam block [9770044](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/block/9770044){target=\_blank}.

The fix consisted of resetting the previously consumed weight before tracing each Ethereum transaction. It's important to note that this issue only affected code under `evm-tracing`, which is not included in any production runtime.

This bug was fixed in the following runtime:

|    Network     | Fixed  | Impacted Block |
|:--------------:|:------:|:--------------:|
|    Moonbeam    | RT3501 |    9770044     |

#### Notify Inactive Collator Fails for Long-Inactive Collators {: #notify-inactive-collator-fails }

The `notifyInactiveCollator` extrinsic, designed to remove collators from the pool if they haven't produced any blocks in the last two rounds, failed for collators who had been inactive for significantly longer than two rounds. The transaction would only succeed within the first few blocks of a new round.

The bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT2601   | RT3500 |  5474345 – 10750816  |

### Parachain Staking Pallet {: #parachain-staking }

#### Update Collator State Storage Item {: #update-collator-state-storage-item }

A migration was applied that updated the `Collator` storage item of the parachain staking pallet to the new `Collator2` storage item. This change updated the collator state to include the following items:

- The `nominators` set is a list of all of the nominator (delegator) account IDs without their respective balance bonded
- A new `top_nominators` storage item that returns a list of all of the top nominators ordered by greatest bond amount to least
- A new `bottom_nominators` storage item that returns a list of all of the bottom nominators ordered by least bond amount to greatest
- The `total` storage item was replaced with `total_counted` and `total_backing`. The `total_counted` item returns the sum of the top nominations and the collator's self-bond, whereas the `total_backing` item returns the sum of all of the nominations and the collator's self-bond

This migration was only applied to Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|

#### Support Delayed Nominator (Delegator) Exits {: #support-delayed-nominator-exits }

The exit queue for handling candidate exits had been updated to include support for delayed nominator (delegator) exits and revocations, which required a migration to update the `ExitQueue` parachain staking pallet storage item to `ExitQueue2`. The `NominatorState` storage item was also migrated to `NominatorState2` to prevent a nominator from performing more nominations when they already have scheduled an exit.

These migrations were only applied to Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|

#### Support Manual Exits and DPoS Terminology {: #support-manual-exits-dpos-terminology }

The parachain staking pallet was updated to include manual exits. If a candidate or delegator wanted to decrease or revoke their bond or leave the candidate or delegator pool, they would need to schedule a request first, wait for a delay period to pass, and then manually execute the request. As such, a migration was applied to replace the automatic exit queue, including the `ExitQueue2` storage item, with a manual exits API.

In addition, a change was made to switch from Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) terminology; this marked the sweeping change from "nominate" to "delegate". This required the migration of the following parachain staking pallet storage items:

- `CollatorState2` was migrated to `CandidateState`
- `NominatorState2` was migrated to `DelegatorState`

These migrations were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1001      |     5165      |

#### Auto-Compounding Support {: #auto-compounding-support }

To support auto-compounding, two migrations were applied to the `AtStake` storage item in the parachain staking pallet:

- `RemovePaidRoundsFromAtStake` - to remove any stale `AtStake` entries relating to already paid-out rounds with candidates that didn't produce any blocks. This migration is a prerequisite for the `MigrateAtStakeAutoCompound` migration
- `MigrateAtStakeAutoCompound` - migrates the snapshots for unpaid rounds for `AtStake` entries

#### ParachainStaking: Currency → Fungible Migration {: #parachainstaking-currency-to-fungible }

A migration was applied to move the `ParachainStaking` pallet from the deprecated Currency trait to the modern Fungible trait. Operationally, staking “locks” were replaced by balance “freezes”: queries that previously read `Balances.Locks` with identifiers [`stkngcol`, `stkngdel`] must now read `Balances.Freezes` with freeze reasons [`StakingCollator`, `StakingDelegator`]. The frozen balance shown in `System.Account` is unchanged by this migration.

### Referenda Pallet {: #referenda-pallet }

#### Refunds for Submission Deposits {: #refunds-for-submission-deposits }

A migration was introduced to support refunds for submission deposits on closed referenda that updated the `ReferendumInfo` type. The following invariants of `ReferendumInfo` were changed so that the second parameter, `Deposit<AccountId, Balance>`, is now optional, `Option<Deposit<AccountId, Balance>>`: `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Cancelled`, and `TimedOut`.

This stemmed from an upstream change to the [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12788){target=\_blank} repository.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

#### Restore Corrupted Referenda Deposits {: restore-corrupted-referenda-deposits }

A migration was introduced to support restoring referenda deposits affected by corrupted storage values. The issue arose when a migration was applied twice due to a pallet version error, resulting in invalid values and non-refundable submission deposits. As the number of values to correct was finite and small, this migration created a list to update them by hand.

This migration was only applied to Moonbeam and was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

| Network  | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| Moonbeam |      RT3100      |    7303601    |

### XCM-Related Pallets {: #xcm-related-pallets }

#### Update Transact Info Storage Item {: #update-transaction-info }

There was a migration applied to the `TransactInfo` storage item of the XCM Transactor Pallet that changed the following items:

- `max_weight` is added to prevent transactors from stalling the queue in the destination chain
- Removes `fee_per_byte`, `metadata_size`, and `base_weight` as these items are not necessary for XCM transactions
- `fee_per_second` replaces `fee_per_weight` to better reflect cases (like Kusama) in which the `fee_per_weight` unit is lower than one

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1201      |    415946     |
|   Moonriver    |      RT1201      |    1471037    |
| Moonbase Alpha |      RT1200      |    1648994    |

#### Add Support for Kusama Asset Hub (Statemine) Prefix Breaking Change {: #add-support-statemine-prefix }

The following three migrations were added to the asset manager pallet to avoid issues with Kusama Asset Hub's (previously referred to as Statemine) [breaking change to the way it represents assets](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/831){target=\_blank} and possible future breaking changes:

- `UnitsWithAssetType` - updates the `AssetTypeUnitsPerSecond` storage item to a mapping of the `AssetType` to `units_per_second`, instead of the mapping `AssetId` to `units_per_second`. This is done to avoid additional migrations whenever a breaking change arises
- `PopulateAssetTypeIdStorage` - creates a new `AssetTypeId` storage item that holds the `AssetType` to `AssetId` mapping, which allows the decoupling of `assetIds` and `AssetTypes`
- `ChangeStateminePrefixes` - updates already registered Kusama Asset Hub (Statemine) assets to their new form

These migrations were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1201      |    415946     |

#### Add New Supported Fee Payment Assets Storage Item {: #add-supported-fee-payment-assets }

A migration was applied to the asset manager pallet, creating a new `SupportedFeePaymentAssets` storage item by reading the supported asset data from the `AssetTypeUnitsPerSecond` storage item. This storage item will hold all the assets we accept for XCM fee payment. It will be read when an incoming XCM message is received, and if the asset is not in storage, the message will not be processed.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1300      |    524762     |
|   Moonriver    |      RT1300      |    1541735    |

#### Update the XCM Transactor Storage from V2 to V3 {: #update-xcm-transactor }

With the support of XCM V3, a migration was applied to update the XCM Transactor pallet's storage from XCM V2 to V3. The `transactInfoWithWeightLimit` and `destinationAssetFeePerSecond` storage items were updated to support XCM V3 multilocations.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT2302      |    3456477    |
|   Moonriver    |      RT2302      |    4133065    |
| Moonbase Alpha |      RT2301      |    4172407    |

#### Remove Mintable XC-20s {: #remove-local-assets }

Mintable XC-20s were deprecated in favor of XCM-enabled ERC-20s; as such, a migration was applied to remove the local assets pallet and clear the assets in storage.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT2801      |    5899847    |
|   Moonriver    |      RT2801      |    6411588    |

#### Manage Foreign Assets via Smart Contracts  {: #foreign-assets-migration }

A migration was applied to transition existing foreign assets to a new design that manages XCM derivative assets on Moonbeam through EVM smart contracts instead of the previous implementation using the Asset and Asset Manager pallets. The migration process involved several extrinsics in the Moonbeam Lazy Migration pallet:

- **`approve_assets_to_migrate`** - sets the list of asset IDs approved for migration
- **`start_foreign_asset_migration`** - initiates migration for a specific foreign asset by freezing the original asset and creating a new EVM smart contract
- **`migrate_foreign_asset_balances`** - migrates asset balances in batches from old assets pallet to the new system
- **`migrate_foreign_asset_approvals`** - migrates asset approvals in batches while unreserving deposits from the old approval system
- **`finish_foreign_asset_migration`** - completes migration after all balances and approvals are migrated and performs final cleanup

This migration preserves compatibility with existing foreign assets by identifying each foreign asset with the same AssetID integer as before. This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT3501      |    10056989   |
|   Moonriver    |      RT3501      |    10665393   |

### Nimbus Author Filter Pallet {: #nimbus }

#### Replace Eligible Ratio with Eligible Count {: #replace-eligible-ratio }

A breaking change was applied to the Nimbus repository, deprecating `EligibleRatio` in favor of the `EligibleCount` config. As a result, a migration was applied to the Moonbeam repository, populating the new `EligibleCount` value as a percentage of the potential authors defined at that block height if the `EligibleRatio` value existed. Otherwise, the value was set to a default value of `50`.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1502      |    1107285    |
|   Moonriver    |      RT1502      |    1814458    |
| Moonbase Alpha |      RT1502      |    2112058    |

# Runtime Upgrades

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam runtime upgrades allow for the maintenance and evolution of the chain logic without the need for a hard fork. These runtime upgrades can introduce new features, improve performance, fix bugs, and respond to changing requirements.

This page provides a historical record of runtime upgrades by block for each of the Moonbeam-based networks.

## Runtime Upgrades by Block {: #runtime-upgrades-by-block }

The following table contains a list of the runtime upgrades and the block at which the upgrade occurred for each network. Runtime upgrades occur first on Moonbase Alpha before being released on Moonriver and then on Moonbeam. You can read the release notes for each runtime on the [Moonbeam releases GitHub page](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank}.

Not all runtime upgrades are released on each network, as sometimes after releasing the initial runtime upgrade, the need for a subsequent upgrade arises. If a runtime upgrade version has been skipped or hasn't been released yet (only applicable to the latest runtime upgrade), you'll see a `-` in that row.

## Precompiled Contracts {: #precompiled-contracts }

There are a set of precompiled contracts included on Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha that are categorized by address and based on the origin network. If you were to convert the precompiled addresses to decimal format, and break them into categories by numeric value, the categories are as follows:

- **0-1023** - [Ethereum MainNet precompiles](#ethereum-mainnet-precompiles)
- **1024-2047** - precompiles that are [not in Ethereum and not Moonbeam specific](#non-moonbeam-specific-nor-ethereum-precomiles)
- **2048-4095** - [Moonbeam specific precompiles](#moonbeam-specific-precompiles)

# Supported Ethereum RPC Methods

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Moonbeam team has collaborated closely with [Parity](https://www.parity.io){target=\_blank} on developing [Frontier](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/){target=\_blank}, an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate-based chains. This layer enables developers to run unmodified Ethereum dApps on Moonbeam seamlessly.

Nevertheless, not all Ethereum JSON-RPC methods are supported; some of those supported return default values (those related to Ethereum's PoW consensus mechanism in particular). This guide provides a comprehensive list of supported Ethereum JSON-RPC methods on Moonbeam. Developers can quickly reference this list to understand the available functionality for interfacing with Moonbeam's Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

## Standard Ethereum JSON-RPC Methods {: #basic-rpc-methods }

    - Moonbeam supports the use of the optional _state override set_ object. This address-to-state mapping object allows the user to specify some state to be ephemerally overridden before executing a call to `eth_call`. The state override set is commonly used for tasks like debugging smart contracts.

## Default Block Parameters {: #default-block-parameters }

Moonbeam supports several default block parameters that allow you to query a subset of JSON-RPC methods at significant block heights. Moonbeam supports the following default block parameters: 

- `finalized` - Refers to the most recent block that Polkadot validators have finalized
- `safe` - Synonymous with `finalized` in Moonbeam. In Ethereum, `safe` refers to the most recent block that is considered safe by the network, meaning it is unlikely to be reverted but has not yet been finalized. With Moonbeam's fast and deterministic finality, `finalized` and `safe` refer to the same blocks. 
- `earliest` - Refers to the genesis block of the blockchain
- `pending` - Represents the latest state, including pending transactions that have not yet been mined into a block. This is a live view of the mempool
- `latest` - Refers to the latest confirmed block in the blockchain, which may not be finalized

## Unsupported Ethereum JSON-RPC Methods {: #unsupported-rpc-methods }

Moonbeam does not support the following Ethereum API JSON-RPC methods:

 - **[eth_getProof](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/ethereum/ethereum-api-endpoints/eth-get-proof){target=\_blank}** - returns the account and storage values of the specified account including the Merkle-proof
 - **[eth_blobBaseFee](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/ethereum/eth_blobBaseFee){target=\_blank}** - returns the expected base fee for blobs in the next block
 - **[eth_createAccessList](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/ethereum/ethereum-api-endpoints/eth-create-access-list){target=\_blank}** - creates an EIP-2930 type `accessList` based on a given transaction object
 - **[eth_sign](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_sign){target=\_blank}** - allows the user to sign an arbitrary hash to be sent at a later time.

# Moonbeam Custom API

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam nodes include support for custom JSON-RPC endpoints: 

- `moon_isBlockFinalized` 
- `moon_isTxFinalized`
- `moon_getEthSyncBlockRange`

These endpoints provide valuable functionality for checking the finality of on-chain events.

To begin exploring Moonbeam's custom JSON-RPC endpoints, you can try out the provided curl examples below. These examples demonstrate how to query the public RPC endpoint of Moonbase Alpha. However, you can easily modify them to use with your own Moonbeam or Moonriver endpoint by changing the URL and API key. If you haven't already, you can obtain your endpoint and API key from one of our supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.

## Supported Custom RPC Methods {: #rpc-methods }

???+ function "moon_isBlockFinalized"

    Checks for the finality of the block given by its block hash.

    === "Parameters"

        - `block_hash` *string* - the hash of the block, accepts either Substrate-style or Ethereum-style block hash as its input

    === "Returns"

        Returns a boolean: `true` if the block is finalized, `false` if the block is not finalized or not found.

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{
          "jsonrpc": "2.0",
          "id": "1",
          "method": "moon_isBlockFinalized",
          "params": ["INSERT_BLOCK_HASH"]
        }' {{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}
        ```

???+ function "moon_isTxFinalized"

    Checks for the finality of a transaction given its EVM transaction hash.

    === "Parameters"

        - `tx_hash` *string* - the EVM transaction hash of the transaction 

    === "Returns"

        Returns a boolean: `true` if the transaction is finalized, `false` if the transaction is not finalized or not found.

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{
          "jsonrpc": "2.0",
          "id": "1",
          "method": "moon_isTxFinalized",
          "params": ["INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH"]
        }' {{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}
        ```

???+ function "moon_getEthSyncBlockRange"

    Returns the range of blocks that are fully indexed in Frontier's backend.

    === "Parameters"

        None

    === "Returns"

        Returns the range of blocks that are fully indexed in Frontier's backend. An example response below includes the Substrate block hashes of block `0` and the latest fully indexed block:

        ```[
        "0x91bc6e169807aaa54802737e1c504b2577d4fafedd5a02c10293b1cd60e39527",

# Overview of the Precompiled Contracts on Moonbeam

## Overview {: #introduction }

On Moonbeam, a precompiled contract is native Substrate code that has an Ethereum-style address and can be called using the Ethereum API, like any other smart contract. The precompiles allow you to call the Substrate runtime directly which is not normally accessible from the Ethereum side of Moonbeam.

The Substrate code responsible for implementing precompiles can be found in the [EVM pallet](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/){target=\_blank}. The EVM pallet includes the [standard precompiles found on Ethereum and some additional precompiles that are not specific to Ethereum](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm/precompile){target=\_blank}. It also provides the ability to create and execute custom precompiles through the generic [`Precompiles` trait](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/trait.Precompile.html){target=\_blank}. There are several custom Moonbeam-specific precompiles that have been created, all of which can be found in the [Moonbeam codebase](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/tree/master/precompiles){target=\_blank}. It is important to highlight that the precompiles from this list with the `CallableByContract` check are not callable inside the contract constructor.

The Ethereum precompiled contracts contain complex functionality that is computationally intensive, such as hashing and encryption. The custom precompiled contracts on Moonbeam provide access to Substrate-based functionality such as staking, governance, XCM-related functions, and more.

The Moonbeam-specific precompiles can be interacted with through familiar and easy-to-use Solidity interfaces using the Ethereum API, which are ultimately used to interact with the underlying Substrate interface. This flow is depicted in the following diagram:

![Precompiled Contracts Diagram](/images/builders/ethereum/precompiles/overview/overview-1.webp)

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam. Please refer to the [Security Considerations](/learn/core-concepts/security/){target=\_blank} page for more information.

## Precompiled Contract Addresses {: #precompiled-contract-addresses }

The precompiled contracts are categorized by address and based on the origin network. If you were to convert the precompiled addresses to decimal format, and break them into categories by numeric value, the categories are as follows:

- **0-1023** - [Ethereum MainNet precompiles](#ethereum-mainnet-precompiles)
- **1024-2047** - precompiles that are [not in Ethereum and not Moonbeam specific](#non-moonbeam-specific-nor-ethereum-precomiles)
- **2048-4095** - [Moonbeam specific precompiles](#moonbeam-specific-precompiles)

# Network Endpoints

## Public Endpoints {: #public-endpoints }

Moonbeam-based networks have two endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

The endpoints in this section are for development purposes only and are not meant to be used in production applications.

If you are looking for an API provider suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](#endpoint-providers) section of this guide.

#### Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

To connect to the Moonbase Alpha relay chain, you can use the following WS Endpoint:

| Provider |                          RPC URL                           |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| OpsLayer | <pre>```wss://relay.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre> |

## RPC Endpoint Providers {: #endpoint-providers }

You can create your own endpoint suitable for development or production use using any of the following API providers:

- [1RPC](#1rpc)
- [Chainstack](#chainstack)
- [dRPC NodeCloud](#drpc)
- [Dwellir](#dwellir)
- [GetBlock](#getblock)
- [OnFinality](#onfinality)
- [UnitedBloc](#unitedbloc)

### 1RPC {: #1rpc}

[1RPC](https://www.1rpc.io){target=_blank} is a free and private RPC relay that protects user privacy by preventing data collection, user tracking, phishing attempts from other parties. It tunnels user requests via distributed relays to other RPC providers whilst preventing the tracking of user metadata such as IP address, device information and wallet linkability with secure enclave technology.

1RPC is created to be an open initiative from the blockchain infrastructure community. They are motivated by a common good mission to help build a better Web3 and encourage anyone who values user privacy to join this open collaboration.

Head over to [1RPC](https://www.1rpc.io){target=_blank} official site to set it up!

![1RPC](/images/builders/get-started/endpoints/endpoints-1.webp)

### Chainstack {: #chainstack }

[Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/){target=_blank}, the Web3 infrastructure provider, offers free and paid endpoints for Moonbeam. The free Developer plan starts with 3 million monthly requests and 25 requests per second (RPS). You can easily scale with the paid plans.

### Dwellir {: #dwellir }

[Dwellir](https://www.dwellir.com){target=_blank} is a blockchain operation service that ensures global scalability, low latency, and a 99.99% uptime guarantee, providing fast and reliable node operations wherever your business stands. The public endpoint service is geographically distributed bare metal servers globally. As the service is public, there are no sign-up or API keys to manage.

To get started with a developer endpoint or dedicated node, you'll need to contact us:

1. Visit [Dwellir](https://www.dwellir.com/contact){target=_blank}
2. Submit your **email** and your node request

![Dwellir](/images/builders/get-started/endpoints/endpoints-3.webp)

### GetBlock {: #getblock }

[GetBlock](https://getblock.io){target=_blank} is a service that provides instant API access to Moonbeam and Moonriver and is available through shared and dedicated nodes. [Dedicated nodes](https://docs.getblock.io/getting-started/plans-and-limits/choosing-your-plan#dedicated-nodes){target=_blank} provide access to a private server with fast speeds and without rate limits. [Shared nodes](https://docs.getblock.io/getting-started/plans-and-limits/choosing-your-plan#shared-nodes){target=_blank} provide a free API/add-on based endpoint for you to get started quickly.

To get started with GetBlock, you can go to the [GetBlock registration page](https://account.getblock.io/sign-up){target=_blank} and sign up for a new account. Then, from your account **Dashboard**, you can view and manage your existing endpoints for multiple protocols, and also create new ones.

Creating a new API/add-on based endpoint is simple, all you have to do is:

1. Fill the information for the desired protocol from the list of available blockchains
2. Choose the network you want your endpoint to point to (**Mainnet**, **Testnet**, etc)
3. Select **JSON-RPC** from the **API/Add-on** dropdown
4. Click the **Get** button at the far right and you're all set to go!

## Lazy Loading with RPC Endpoint Providers {: #lazy-loading-with-RPC-Endpoint-Providers }

Lazy loading lets a Moonbeam node operate while downloading network state in the background, eliminating the need to wait for full synchronization before use. To spin up a Moonbeam node with lazy loading, you'll need to either [download the Moonbeam release binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#the-release-binary){target=_blank} or [compile the binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/compile-binary/#compile-the-binary){target=_blank}. You can activate lazy loading with the following flag:

`--lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT-RPC-URL'`

Lazy loading is highly resource-intensive, requiring many RPC requests to function. To avoid being throttled, it's recommended that you use a [dedicated endpoint](#endpoint-providers) (i.e., an endpoint with an API key) rather than a public endpoint. You will likely be rate-limited if you use lazy loading with a public endpoint. Upon spooling up a node with this feature, you'll see output like the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty>[Lazy loading 🌗]
    <br>You are now running the Moonbeam client in lazy loading mode, where data is retrieved
    <br>from a live RPC node on demand.
    <br>Using remote state from: https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com
    <br>Forking from block: 8482853
    <br>To ensure the client works properly, please note the following:
    <br>    1. *Avoid Throttling*: Ensure that the backing RPC node is not limiting the number of
    <br>    requests, as this can prevent the lazy loading client from functioning correctly;
    <br>    2. *Be Patient*: As the client may take approximately 20 times longer than normal to
    <br>    retrieve and process the necessary data for the requested operation.
    <br>The service will start in 10 seconds...</span>
</div>

### Overriding State with Lazy Loading

By default, you won't see detailed logging in the terminal. To override this setting and show lazy loading logs, you can add the following flag to your command to start the Moonbeam node: `-l debug`. You can further customize your use of the lazy loading functionality with the following optional parameters:

- **`--lazy-loading-block`** - specifies a block hash from which to start loading data. If not provided, the latest block will be used
- **`--lazy-loading-delay-between-requests`** - the delay (in milliseconds) between RPC requests when using lazy loading. This parameter controls the amount of time to wait between consecutive RPC requests. This can help manage request rate and avoid overwhelming the server. Default value is `100` milliseconds
- **`--lazy-loading-max-retries-per-request`** - the maximum number of retries for an RPC request when using lazy loading. Default value is `10` retries
- **`--lazy-loading-runtime-override`** - path to a WASM file to override the runtime when forking. If not provided, it will fetch the runtime from the block being forked
- **`--lazy-loading-state-overrides`** - path to a JSON file containing state overrides to be applied when forking

#### Simple Storage Item Override

The state overrides file should define the respective pallet, storage item, and value that you seek to override as follows:

```json
[
 {
     "pallet": "System",
     "storage": "SelectedCandidates",
     "value": "0x04f24ff3a9cf04c71dbc94d0b566f7a27b94566cac"
 }
]
```

#### Override an Account's Free Balance

To override the balance of a particular account, you can override the account storage item of the system pallet for the respective account as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "pallet": "System",
    "storage": "Account",
    "key": "TARGET_ADDRESS",
    "value": "0x460c000002000000010000000600000069e10de76676d0800000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080"
  }
]
```

??? note "Details about overriding account balances"

    Overriding an account balance, as shown above, can be a complex process. However, this guide will break it down into steps that are easy to follow. Before making any changes, you should obtain the existing value corresponding to the key (i.e., the account in this case). You can go to [**Chain State** on Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network#/chainstate){target=_blank} and query the System pallet by providing the account you'd like to query. Upon submitting the query, you'll get back a readable account structure like so:

    ```text
    {
      nonce: 3,142
      consumers: 2
      providers: 1
      sufficients: 6
      data: {
        free: 1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676
        reserved: 348,052,500,000,000,000,000
        frozen: 20,413,910,106,633,175,872
        flags: 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
      }
    }
    ```

    While this is useful as a reference, the information you're looking for is the encoded storage key, which is accessible even without submitting the chain state query. In this instance, the encoded storage key corresponding to the system pallet and the selected account `0x3B939FeaD1557C741Ff06492FD0127bd287A421e` is:

    ```text
    0x26aa394eea5630e07c48ae0c9558cef7b99d880ec681799c0cf30e8886371da9b882fedb4f75b055c709ec5b66b5d9933b939fead1557c741ff06492fd0127bd287a421e
    ```

    Note that this encoded storage key will change alongside any input changes, such as a different account being queried. Then, head over the **Raw Storage** tab on [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate/raw){target=_blank}. Input the above storage key and submit the query. The response is the SCALE encoded account struct, a part of which contains the free balance information to be modified as part of this example: 

    ```text
    0x460c0000020000000100000006000000a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080
    ```

    There is quite a bit of data encoded in the value field because it is a complex struct comprised of multiple values. The struct is comprised of:

    ```text
    struct AccountInfo {
        nonce: u32,             // Transaction count
        consumers: u32,         // Number of consumers 
        providers: u32,         // Number of providers
        sufficients: u32,       // Number of sufficients
        data: AccountData {     // The balance info
            free: u128,         // Free balance
            reserved: u128,     // Reserved balance
            frozen: u128,       // Frozen balance
            flags: u128         // Account flags
        }
    }
    ```

    You can associate each part of the SCALE encoded struct with the corresponding piece of Alice's account information that it represents:

    ```text
    0x460c0000        // nonce (u32): 3,142 
    02000000          // consumers (u32): 2
    01000000          // providers (u32): 1  
    06000000          // sufficients (u32): 6

    a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045000000000000000  
    // free (u128): 1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676

    40a556b0e032de1200000000000000000  
    // reserved (u128): 348,052,500,000,000,000,000  

    4083a09e15c74c1b01000000000000000  
    // frozen (u128): 20,413,910,106,633,175,872

    00000000000000000000000000000080   
    // flags (u128): 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
    ```

    Remember that the values are little endian encoded. To convert the hexadecimal little endian encoded values to decimal, you can use [Substrate Utilities converter](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/){target=_blank}, using the **Balance to Hex (Little Endian)** converter.

    In this example, the existing free balance of `1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676` Wei or approximately `1278.60` DEV is `a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045`. The following example will change the value to `500,000` DEV, which is `500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000` Wei or `0x000080d07666e70de169` encoded as a hexadecimal little endian value. When properly padded to fit into the SCALE encoded storage value, it becomes `69e10de76676d08000000000000000000`, such that the table now looks like:

    ```text
    0x460c0000        // nonce (u32): 3,142 
    02000000          // consumers (u32): 2
    01000000          // providers (u32): 1  
    06000000          // sufficients (u32): 6

    69e10de76676d08000000000000000000
    // free (u128): 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

    40a556b0e032de1200000000000000000  
    // reserved (u128): 348,052,500,000,000,000,000  

    4083a09e15c74c1b01000000000000000  
    // frozen (u128): 20,413,910,106,633,175,872

    00000000000000000000000000000080   
    // flags (u128): 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
    ```

    Therefore, the SCALE encoded override value is as follows:

    ```text
    0x460c000002000000010000000600000069e10de76676d0800000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080
    ```

    You can now specify the SCALE encoded override value in your `state-overrides.json` file as follows:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "pallet": "System",
        "storage": "Account",
        "key": "0x3b939fead1557c741ff06492fd0127bd287a421e",
        "value": "0x460c000002000000010000000600000069e10de76676d0800000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080"
      }
    ]
    ```

    To run lazy loading with the balance state override, you can use the following command: 

    ```bash
    --lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT_RPC_URL' --lazy-loading-state-overrides ./state-overrides.json
    ```

#### Override an ERC-20 Token Balance

To override an ERC-20 token balance, identify the storage slot in the EVM’s AccountStorages where the `balanceOf` data for the given token contract and account is stored. This storage slot is determined by the token contract’s H160 address and the corresponding H256 storage key. Once you have this slot, specify the new balance value in the `state-overrides.json` file to implement the override.

In the example below, we override the token balance of the [Wormhole USDC Contract (`0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c`)](https://moonscan.io/address/0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c){target=_blank} for the account `0x3b939fead1557c741ff06492fd0127bd287a421e` to $5,000 USDC. Since Wormhole USDC uses 6 decimal places, $5,000 corresponds to `5000000000` in integer form, which is `0x12a05f200` in hexadecimal.

```json
[
    {
        "pallet": "EVM",
        "storage": "AccountStorages",
        "key": [
            "0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c",
            "0x8c9902c0f94ae586c91ba539eb52087d3dd1578da91158308d79ff24a8d4f342"
        ],
        "value": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012a05f200"
    }
]
```

You can calculate the exact storage slot to override for your own account with the following script:

```js
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

function getBalanceSlot(accountAddress) {
  // Convert address to bytes32 and normalize
  const addr = ethers.zeroPadValue(accountAddress, 32);

  // CAUTION! The storage slot used here is 5, which
  // is specific to Wormhole contracts
  // The storage slot index for other tokens may vary
  const packedData = ethers.concat([
    addr,
    ethers.zeroPadValue(ethers.toBeHex(5), 32),
  ]);

  // Calculate keccak256
  return ethers.keccak256(packedData);
}

// Example usage
const address = 'INSERT_ADDRESS';
console.log(getBalanceSlot(address));
```

You can apply the same process for other ERC-20 token contracts. The following sections demonstrate overrides for the `0x3B939FeaD1557C741Ff06492FD0127bd287A421e` account with various ERC-20 tokens. Remember to update the H160 token contract address whenever you switch to a different token. Also, you will need to recalculate the H256 storage slot for each distinct account whose balance you want to override.

??? code "Example: Override WELL Token Balance"

    Because the [WELL token](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/token/0x511ab53f793683763e5a8829738301368a2411e3){target=_blank} does not use a proxy implementation contract, the storage slot calculation differs. Instead of slot `5`, the balance mapping resides at slot `1`. You can determine the exact storage slot to override the WELL token balance for your own account using the following script:

    ```js
    import { ethers } from 'ethers';

    function getBalanceSlot(accountAddress) {
      // Convert address to bytes32 and normalize
      const addr = ethers.zeroPadValue(accountAddress, 32);

      // Caution! The storage slot index used here is 1
      // The storage slot index for other tokens may vary
      const packedData = ethers.concat([
        addr,
        ethers.zeroPadValue(ethers.toBeHex(1), 32),
      ]);

      // Calculate keccak256
      return ethers.keccak256(packedData);
    }

    // Example usage
    const address = 'INSERT_ADDRESS';
    console.log(getBalanceSlot(address));
    ```

    Thus, the storage override would be:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "pallet": "EVM",
            "storage": "AccountStorages",
            "key": [
                "0x511aB53F793683763E5a8829738301368a2411E3",
                "0x728d3daf4878939a6bb58cbc263f39655bb57ea15db7daa0b306f3bf2c3f1227"
            ],
            "value": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012a05f200"
        }
    ]
    ```

## Tracing RPC Endpoint Providers {: #tracing-providers }

Tracing RPC endpoints allow you to access non-standard RPC methods, such as those that belong to Geth's `debug` and `txpool` APIs and OpenEthereum's `trace` module. To see a list of the supported non-standard RPC methods on Moonbeam for debugging and tracing, please refer to the [Debug API & Trace Module](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/){target=_blank} guide.

The following providers provide tracing RPC endpoints:

- [OnFinality](#onfinality-tracing)

### OnFinality {: #onfinality-tracing }

[OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/en){target=_blank}'s Trace API can be used to quickly get started tracing and debugging transactions on Moonbeam and Moonriver. It is only available to users on their [Growth and Ultimate plans](https://onfinality.io/en/pricing){target=_blank}.

To use the Trace API, you simply call the trace method of your choice from your [private RPC endpoint](#onfinality). For a list of the supported networks and trace methods, please check out [OnFinality's Trace API documentation](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/trace-api#TraceAPI-SupportedNetworks){target=_blank}.

Please note that if you are tracing historic blocks, it is recommended to use your own dedicated trace node to backfill any data, and then once you're caught up, you can switch to using the Trace API. You can check out the [How to Deploy a Trace Node for Moonbeam on OnFinality](https://onfinality.medium.com/how-to-deploy-a-trace-node-for-moonbeam-on-onfinality-85683181d290){target=-_blank} post for more information on how to spin up your own dedicated trace node.
