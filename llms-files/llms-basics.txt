# Moonbeam Account Balances

## Introduction {: #introduction }

While Moonbeam strives to be compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, there are some important Moonbeam differences that developers should know and understand in terms of account balances.

One of the design goals of Moonbeam is to create an environment that is as close as possible to Ethereum, and to offer a set of Web3 RPC endpoints that are compatible with Ethereum. However, Moonbeam is also a Substrate based chain, which means that it exposes Substrate RPCs, and that it has integral functionality that is powered by Substrate such as Staking, Governance, and other features which are not part of the Ethereum API.

Moonbeam [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} are one way that Moonbeam achieves Ethereum compatibility, by changing the underlying account type in the protocol to be Ethereum-like (H160 or 20 byte addresses starting with `0x`). Unified accounts are used by both the Substrate and Ethereum APIs, and map to the same underlying data storage on the blockchain. Nevertheless, there are important differences that users coming from Ethereum should understand when using Moonbeam accounts via the Ethereum API.

This guide will outline some of these main differences and what to expect when using Moonbeam for the first time.

## Ethereum Account Balances {: #ethereum-account-balances }

An account on Ethereum is an entity with a token balance (Ether or ETH in this case). Account-holders can send Ether transactions on Ethereum and accounts can be controlled by either users (with the private key for signing) or smart contracts.

Therefore, Ethereum has two main types of accounts: user-owned and contract-owned. No matter the type, an Ethereum account has a single balance field that represents the number of Wei owned by this address, where Wei is a denomination of ETH (1 x 10^18 Wei per ETH).

![Ethereum balances diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/balances/balances-1.webp)

## Moonbeam Account Balances {: #moonbeam-account-balances }

An account on Moonbeam is also an entity with a token balance (the token will depend on the network). Like on Ethereum, account holders can send token transactions on the Moonbeam Network they are connected to. In addition, accounts can be controlled by users (with the private key for signing) or smart contracts.

As with Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: user-owned and contract owned. However, on Moonbeam, within both account types, there are also [proxy accounts](https://wiki.polkadot.network/learn/learn-proxies/){target=\_blank}, which can perform a limited number of actions on behalf of another account. In terms of balances, all of Moonbeam account types have five (5) different [balance types](https://wiki.polkadot.network/learn/learn-accounts/#balance-types){target=\_blank}:

 - **Free** — refers to the balance that can be used (not locked/frozen) from the Substrate API. The concept of `free` balance depends on the action to be executed. For example, voting in democracy will not subtract the allocated balance to the vote from `free` balance, but token holders won't be able to transfer that balance
 - **Reducible** — refers to the balance that can be used (not locked/frozen) through the Ethereum API on Moonbeam. For example, this is the balance displayed by MetaMask. It is the real spendable balance, accounting for all democracy locks (displayed as transferable in Polkadot.js Apps)
 - **Reserved** — refers to the balance held due to on-chain requirements, and that can be freed by performing some on-chain action.  For example, bonds for creating a proxy account or setting an on-chain identity are shown as `reserved balance`. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed
 - **Misc frozen** — represents a balance that the `free` balance may not drop below when withdrawing funds, except for transaction fee payment. For example, funds being used to vote on a governance proposal are shown as `misc frozen`. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed
 - **Fee frozen** — represents a balance that the `free` balance may not drop below when specifically paying for transaction fees. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed

![Moonbeam balances diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/balances/balances-2.webp)

### Calculating Your Transferable Balance {: #calculating-your-transferable-balance }

An account's transferable or spendable balance can be calculated as the free balance minus the maximum of `0` or the difference between frozen and reserved tokens: 

```text
Transferable = free - max(0, frozen - reserved )
```

Here are two examples of calculating transferable balances:

An account has `1000` free tokens, `200` frozen tokens, and `50` reserved tokens. The transferable balance is calculated as:

```text
Transferable = 1000 - max(0, 200 - 50) = 1000 - 150 = 850
```

If the frozen tokens are less than the reserved tokens, with `1000` free tokens, `100` frozen tokens, and `150` reserved tokens, the transferable balance would be:

```text
Transferable = 1000 - max(0, 100 - 150) = 1000 - 0 = 1000
```

### Retrieve Your Balance {: #retrieve-your-balance }

You can check on your balances, including your free (or transferable) and reserved balances (if exists), using the [Polkadot.js API](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}.

!!! note
    To test out the examples in this guide on Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network');

const main = async () => {
  const polkadotApi = await ApiPromise.create({
    provider: wsProvider,
  });

  const balances = await polkadotApi.query.system.account('INSERT_ADDRESS');
  console.log(balances.toHuman());
};

main();
```

You can also retrieve your balance locks using the Polkadot.js API.

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network');

const main = async () => {
  const polkadotApi = await ApiPromise.create({
    provider: wsProvider,
  });

  const locks = await polkadotApi.query.balances.locks('INSERT_ADDRESS');
  console.log(locks.toHuman());
};

main();
```

## Main Differences {: #main-differences }

The main difference between account balances on Ethereum and Moonbeam lies in the concept of locked and reserved balance on Moonbeam. These are tokens that are still owned by that account, but they are not spendable (yet).

From the Ethereum's API perspective, an account might show that it has a certain balance (called `reducible` balance). However, after an on-chain action, this value might increase (or decrease) without an actual balance transfer.

It is important to note that the account and behavior differences described here apply to account balances with the base asset (GLMR, MOVR) only and the balances of that asset that aren't interacting with smart contracts. As soon as a Moonbeam account balance is interacting with smart contracts, the behavior will be the same as Ethereum behavior. For example, if you wrap MOVR on Moonriver there is no way for the underlying balance to change via staking or governance actions, because that is part of the storage of the contract. In this case the reducible balance of that account has been committed to the wrapped MOVR smart contract and can't be modified by Substrate actions.

# Get Started with Moonbase Alpha

## Network Endpoints {: #network-endpoints }

Moonbase Alpha has two types of endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

If you're looking for your own endpoints suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. Otherwise, to get started quickly you can use one of the following public HTTPS or WSS endpoints.

=== "HTTPS"
    |      Provider       |                              RPC URL                               |   Limits    |
    |:-------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|

    |     RadiumBlock     |  <pre>```wss://moonbase.public.curie.radiumblock.co/ws```</pre>   | 200 req/sec |


#### Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

To connect to the Moonbase Alpha relay chain, you can use the following WS Endpoint:

| Provider |                          RPC URL                           |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| OpsLayer | <pre>```wss://relay.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre> |

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

For the [Web3.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}, you can create a local Web3 instance and set the provider to connect to Moonbase Alpha (both HTTP and WS are supported):

```js
const { Web3 } = require('web3'); // Load Web3 library
.
.
.
// Create local Web3 instance - set Moonbase Alpha as provider
const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network'); 
```

For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonbase Alpha:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network';
// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1287,
    name: 'moonbase-alphanet'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonbase Alpha TestNet chain ID is: `1287`, which is `0x507` in hex.

## Block Explorers

For Moonbase Alpha, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonbase.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=MoonbaseAlpha){target=\_blank}
 - **Substrate API** — [Subscan](https://moonbase.subscan.io){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}

For more information on each of the available block explorers, please head to the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation.

## Connect MetaMask

# Get Started with Moonbeam

## Network Endpoints {: #network-endpoints }

Moonbeam has two types of endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

If you're looking for your own endpoints suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. Otherwise, to get started quickly you can use one of the following public HTTPS or WSS endpoints:

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

Before getting started, make sure you've retrieved your own endpoint and API key from one of the custom [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}. Then for the [Web3.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}, you can create a local Web3 instance and set the provider to connect to Moonbeam (both HTTP and WS are supported):

```js
const { Web3 } = require('web3'); // Load Web3 library
.
.
.
// Create local Web3 instance - set Moonbeam as provider
const web3 = new Web3('INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT'); // Insert your RPC URL here
```

For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonbeam:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT'; // Insert your RPC URL here

// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1284,
    name: 'moonbeam'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonbeam chain ID is: `1284`, or `0x504` in hex.

## Block Explorers {: #block-explorers }

For Moonbeam, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=Moonbeam){target=\_blank}
 - **Substrate API** — [Subscan](https://moonbeam.subscan.io){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}

For more information on each of the available block explorers, please head to the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation.

## Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to Moonbeam:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbeam">Connect MetaMask</a>

# Quick Start Guide for Developing on Moonbeam

## Quick Overview {: #overview }

Moonbeam is a fully Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on Polkadot. As such, you can interact with Moonbeam via the [Ethereum API](/builders/ethereum/){target=\_blank} and [Substrate API](/builders/substrate/){target=\_blank}.

Although Moonbeam is a Substrate-based platform, Moonbeam uses a [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} system, which replaces Substrate-style accounts and keys with Ethereum-style accounts and keys. As a result, you can interact with your Moonbeam account with [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}, [Ledger](/tokens/connect/ledger/){target=\_blank}, and other Ethereum-compatible wallets by simply adding Moonbeam's network configurations. Similarly, you can develop on Moonbeam using Ethereum [libraries](/builders/ethereum/libraries/){target=\_blank} and [development environments](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/){target=\_blank}.

## Moonbeam Networks {: #moonbeam-networks }

To get started developing on Moonbeam, it's important to be aware of the various networks within the Moonbeam ecosystem.

|                                          Network                                          | Network Type  |                                   Relay Chain                                    | Native Asset Symbol | Native Asset Decimals |

|          [Moonriver](/builders/get-started/networks/moonriver/){target=\_blank}           |    MainNet    |                 [Kusama](https://kusama.network){target=\_blank}                 |        MOVR         |          18           |
|        [Moonbase Alpha](/builders/get-started/networks/moonbase/){target=\_blank}         |    TestNet    | [Alphanet relay](/learn/platform/networks/moonbase/#relay-chain){target=\_blank} |         DEV         |          18           |
| [Moonbeam Development Node](/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam-dev/){target=\_blank} | Local TestNet |                                       None                                       |         DEV         |          18           |

!!! note
    A Moonbeam development node doesn't have a relay chain as its purpose is to be your own personal development environment where you can get started developing quickly without the overhead of a relay chain.

### Network Configurations {: #network-configurations }

When working with developer tools, depending on the tool, you might need to configure Moonbeam to interact with the network. To do so, you can use the following information:

    | Local RPC URL | <pre>```{{ networks.development.rpc_url }}```</pre>  |
    | Local WSS URL | <pre>```{{ networks.development.wss_url }}```</pre>  |

!!! note
    You can create your own endpoint suitable for development or production from one of the [supported RPC providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank}.

### Block Explorers {: #explorers }

Moonbeam provides two different kinds of explorers: ones to query the Ethereum API, and others dedicated to the Substrate API. All EVM-based transactions are accessible via the Ethereum API whereas the Substrate API can be relied upon for Substrate-native functions such as governance, staking, and some information about EVM-based transactions. For more information on each explorer, please check out the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} page.
