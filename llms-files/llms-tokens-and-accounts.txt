# Add Token Information on Moonscan

## Introduction {: #introduction }

This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding a profile for your ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155 tokens to [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank}.

​​Moonscan is a block explorer and analytics platform for EVM-compatible chains. It is an integration of Moonbeam and Etherscan, and it allows users and developers to have access to developer tools and network statistics that provide granular insights into the EVM of Moonriver and Moonbeam.

Developers can create a profile for their tokens on Moonriver and Moonbeam. The profile captures basic information about the project behind the token, social media links, links to price data, and other information pertaining to the project’s token sales.

![Example token profile](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-1.webp)

This tutorial will show you how to create a profile on Moonscan of a sample ERC-20 token, called DemoToken (DEMO), deployed to Moonriver. These instructions can be adapted for any of the Moonbeam-based networks, as well as for an ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have the following:

- A [Moonscan Account](https://moonscan.io/register){target=\_blank}

You will need to verify ownership of the token contract address later on in this guide. You can either do this manually or automatically, but if you choose to do it automatically you'll also need the following:

- Access to the account that deployed the token contract, so you can sign messages as the owner
- MetaMask installed and connected to the network where the token is deployed to

## Getting Started {: #getting-started }

To get started, you'll need to make sure that you are logged into your Moonscan account. Once you’re signed into your account, you can go to the token page of the token you want to add a profile for. For ERC-20s, you can search the name of the token in the search bar. Or for any token, you can manually enter in the URL.

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    https://moonscan.io/token/INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    https://moonriver.moonscan.io/token/INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS 
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    https://moonbase.moonscan.io/token/INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
    ```

Next to Social Profiles, you can click on **Update**.

![Update token](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-2.webp)

You’ll be taken to the **Token Update Application Form**.

If you haven’t verified your contract source code yet, you will need to do so before you can proceed to the next step. If you have already verified your contract, you can skip ahead to the [Verifying Address Ownership](#verifying-address-ownership) section.

## Verifying Contract Source Code {: #verifying-contract-source-code }

You can verify your contract source code a couple of ways. You can directly verify it from Moonscan, or if you developed the contract with Hardhat or Foundry, you can also use their corresponding [Etherscan integrations](/builders/ethereum/verify-contracts/etherscan-plugins/){target=\_blank}.

To verify your contract source code directly from Moonscan, you can click on the **tool** link.

![Token update application form](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-3.webp)

You’ll be taken to the **Verify & Publish Contract Source Code** page where you can enter in details about the contract and how it was compiled.

1. Enter the token contract address
2. Select the **Compiler Type** from the dropdown
3. Choose the **Compile Version** you used
4. Then select an **Open Source License Type**
5. Review and click the **I agree to the terms of service** checkbox
6. Click **Continue**

![Verify & publish contract - page 1](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-4.webp)

You’ll be taken to the next page where you can enter in the contract source code and specify additional settings and arguments used.

1. Contract Address and Compiler should already be filled in. If you enabled optimization, you can update the **Optimization** dropdown
2. Enter in a flattened version of the contract source code. To flatten the contract, you can use the Flattener Remix plugin
3. Update the **Constructor Arguments**, **Contract Library Address**, and **Misc Settings** sections if needed
4. Click **I’m not a robot**
5. Finally, click **Verify and Publish**

![Verify & publish contract - page 2](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-5.webp)

Now that your contract source code has been verified, you can move on to the next step, verifying that you’re the contract address owner.

## Verifying Address Ownership {: #verifying-address-ownership }

From the **Token Update Application Form** page, you should see a message at the top of the screen that states you need to verify the contract address owner. To get started with this process, you can click on the **tool** link.

![Token update application form](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-6.webp)

You’ll be taken to the **Verify Address Ownership** page, where you can choose to sign the message verifying your ownership either manually or by connecting to Web3. If you wish to verify ownership manually, you’ll need the message signature hash. Otherwise, if you connect to Web3, the hash will be calculated for you.

![Verify address ownership](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-7.webp)

### Sign Message Manually {: #sign-message-manually }

If you wish to verify ownership manually, you’ll need the message signature hash. If you have calculated the hash yourself, you can click **Sign Message Manually**, enter the **Message Signature Hash**, and click **Verify Ownership**.

![Manually verify address ownership](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-8.webp)

### Connect to Web3 {: #connect-to-web3 }

You can easily calculate the message signature hash using MetaMask. You will need to have the account you deployed the contract with loaded into MetaMask. Then you can click on **Connect to Web3** and MetaMask will pop-up.

1. Select the account to connect with, which should be the account you used to deploy the contract
2. Connect to the account

![Connect MetaMask account](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-9.webp)

Back on the **Verify Address Ownership** page, you can take the following steps

1. Click **Sign with Web3**
2. MetaMask will pop-up and you can **Sign** the message

![Sign message on MetaMask to verify address ownership](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-10.webp)

Once you’ve signed the message, you can then click **Click to Proceed**. You should now see that the **Message Signature Hash** has been automatically populated for you. All you have left to do is click **Verify Ownership**.

![Verify address ownership submission](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-11.webp)

## Creating the Profile {: #creating-the-profile }

Now you can start filling in the necessary information to build the token profile, including project information, social media links, price data links, and more. You should make sure that all the links provided are working and are safe to visit before submitting.

At a minimum you will need to fill in the following information:

- **Request Type**
- **Token Contract Address**
- **Requester Name**
- **Requester Email Address**
- **Official Project Website**
- **Official Project Email Address**
- **Link to download a 32x32 png icon logo**
- **Project Description**

All of the other fields are optional. Once you’ve filled in the information, you can click **Submit** at the bottom of the page.

![Create token profile](/images/builders/get-started/token-profile/profile-12.webp)

And that’s it! You’ve successfully created and submitted a profile for your token on Moonscan! The Moonscan team will review your submission as soon as possible and provide you with further instructions as needed.

title: Add MetaMask to a DApp
description: This tutorial shows you how to integrate MetaMask into a DApp and automatically connect users to Moonbeam with the click of a button.
categories: Tokens and Accounts

# Integrate MetaMask into a DApp

## Introduction {: #introduction }

With the release of MetaMask's [Custom Networks API](https://consensys.io/blog/connect-users-to-layer-2-networks-with-the-metamask-custom-networks-api){target=\_blank}, users can be prompted to add Moonbeam's Testnet, Moonbase Alpha.

This section will take you through the process of adding a "Connect to Moonbase Alpha" button that will prompt users to connect their MetaMask account(s) to Moonbase Alpha. Your users will no longer need to know or worry about Moonbase Alpha's network configurations and adding a custom network to MetaMask. To interact with Moonbeam from your dApp, all users will need to do is click a few buttons to connect to Moonbase Alpha and get started.

MetaMask injects a global Ethereum API into websites users visit at `window.ethereum`, which allows the websites to read and request the users' blockchain data. You'll be using the Ethereum provider to walk your users through the process of adding Moonbase Alpha as a custom network. In general, you will have to:

- Check if the Ethereum provider exists and if it's MetaMask
- Request the user's account address
- Add Moonbase Alpha as a new chain

This guide is divided into two sections. First, it'll cover adding a button that will be used to trigger MetaMask to pop up and connect to Moonbase Alpha. The second part of the guide will create the logic for connecting the user to MetaMask. This way when you click the button you can actually test the functionality as you go through the guide.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To add the Connect MetaMask button you'll need a JavaScript project and the MetaMask browser extension installed for local testing.

It's recommended to use MetaMask's `detect-provider` utility package to detect the provider injected at `window.ethereum`. The package handles detecting the provider for the MetaMask extension and MetaMask Mobile. To install the package in your JavaScript project, run:

```bash
npm install @metamask/detect-provider
```

## Add a Button {: #add-a-button }

You'll start off by adding a button that will be used to connect MetaMask to Moonbase Alpha. You want to start with the button so when you create the logic in the next step you can test the code as you make your way through the guide.

The function you will create in the next section of the guide will be called `configureMoonbaseAlpha`. So the button on click should call `configureMoonbaseAlpha`.

```html
<button onClick={configureMoonbaseAlpha()}>Connect to Moonbase Alpha</button>
```

## Add Logic {: #add-logic }

Now that you have created the button, you need to add the `configureMoonbaseAlpha` function that will be used on click.

1. Detect the provider at `window.ethereum` and check if it's MetaMask. If you want a simple solution you can directly access `window.ethereum`. Or you can use MetaMask's `detect-provider` package and it will detect the provider for MetaMask extension and MetaMask Mobile for you

    ```javascript
    import detectEthereumProvider from '@metamask/detect-provider';
    const configureMoonbaseAlpha = async () => {
      const provider = await detectEthereumProvider({ mustBeMetaMask: true });
      if (provider) {
        // Logic will go here
      } else {
        console.error('Please install MetaMask');
      }
    };
    ```

2. Request the user's accounts by calling the `eth_requestAccounts` method. This will prompt MetaMask to pop up and ask the user to select which accounts they would like to connect to. Behind the scenes, permissions are being checked by calling `wallet_requestPermissions`. Currently the only permissions are for `eth_accounts`. So you're ultimately verifying that you have access to the user's addresses returned from `eth_accounts`. If you're interested in learning more about the permissions system, check out [EIP-2255](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2255){target=\_blank}

    ```javascript
    import detectEthereumProvider from '@metamask/detect-provider';
    const configureMoonbaseAlpha = async () => {
      const provider = await detectEthereumProvider({ mustBeMetaMask: true });
      if (provider) {
        try {
          await provider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
        } catch (e) {
          console.error(e);
        }
      } else {
        console.error('Please install MetaMask');
      }
    };
    ```

    ![Add accounts to MetaMask](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/metamask/metamask-1.webp)

3. Add Moonbase Alpha as a new chain by calling `wallet_addEthereumChain`. This will prompt the user to provide permission to add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network. Once the network has been successfully added, it will also prompt the user to then switch to Moonbase Alpha

    ```javascript
    import detectEthereumProvider from '@metamask/detect-provider';
    const configureMoonbaseAlpha = async () => {
      const provider = await detectEthereumProvider({ mustBeMetaMask: true });
      if (provider) {
        try {
          await provider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
          await provider.request({
            method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
            params: [
              {
                 // Moonbase Alpha's chainId is {{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }}, which is {{ networks.moonbase.hex_chain_id }} in hex
                chainId: '{{ networks.moonbase.hex_chain_id }}',
                chainName: 'Moonbase Alpha',
                nativeCurrency: {
                  name: 'DEV',
                  symbol: 'DEV',
                  decimals: 18,
                },
                rpcUrls: ['{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}'],
                blockExplorerUrls: ['{{ networks.moonbase.block_explorer }}'],
              },
            ],
          });
        } catch (e) {
          console.error(e);
        }
      } else {
        console.error('Please install MetaMask');
      }
    };
    ```

    ![Add and switch networks in MetaMask](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/metamask/metamask-2.webp)

So, now you should have a button that, on click, walks users through the entire process of connecting their MetaMask accounts to Moonbase Alpha.

### Confirm Connection {: #confirm-connection }

It's possible that you'll have logic that relies on knowing whether a user is connected to Moonbase Alpha or not. Perhaps you want to disable the button if the user is already connected. To confirm a user is connected to Moonbase Alpha, you can call `eth_chainId`, which will return the users current chain ID:

```javascript
const chainId = await provider.request({
  method: 'eth_chainId',
});
// Moonbase Alpha's chainId is {{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }}, which is {{ networks.moonbase.hex_chain_id }} in hex
if (chainId === '{{ networks.moonbase.hex_chain_id }}') {
  // At this point, you might want to disable the "Connect" button
  // or inform the user that they are already connected to the
  // Moonbase Alpha testnet
}
```

## Listen to Account Changes {: #listen-to-account-changes }

To ensure that your project or dApp is staying up to date with the latest account information, you can add the `accountsChanged` event listener that MetaMask provides. MetaMask emits this event when the return value of `eth_accounts` changes. If an address is returned, it is your user's most recent account that provided access permissions. If no address is returned, that means the user has not provided any accounts with access permissions.

```javascript
provider.on('accountsChanged', (accounts) => {
  if (accounts.length === 0) {
    // MetaMask is locked or the user doesn't have any connected accounts
    console.log('Please connect to MetaMask.');
  }
});
```

## Listen to Chain Changes {: #listen-to-chain-changes }

To keep your project or dApp up to date with any changes to the connected chain, you'll want to subscribe to the `chainChanged` event. MetaMask emits this event every time the connected chain changes.

```javascript
provider.on('chainChanged', () => {
  // MetaMask recommends reloading the page unless you have good reason not to
  window.location.reload();
});
```

MetaMask recommends reloading the page whenever the chain changes, unless there is a good reason not to, as it's important to always be in sync with chain changes.

# Particle Network Wallet Abstraction

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Particle Network](https://particle.network){target=\_blank} offers Wallet Abstraction services with an Account Abstraction stack, providing a suite of SDKs focused on reducing user onboarding friction. 

By embedding customizable Externally Owned Account (EOA) and [Account Abstraction (AA)](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/aa/introduction#account-abstraction){target=\_blank} components, Particle allows quick 2-click onboarding via social logins like Google, email, and phone, as well as traditional Web3 methods. This approach removes the need for users to manage a conventional wallet, delivering a streamlined, application-specific experience for Web3 interactions.

Particle Network supports Moonbeam, Moonriver, and the Moonbase Alpha TestNet with both standard EOA interactions and native [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337){target=\_blank} `SimpleAccount` implementations, providing full-stack account abstraction.

Key components of Particle Network's Moonbeam integration include:

- **Particle Connect**: Particle's flagship Wallet-as-a-Service solution, offering embedded wallets powered by MPC-TSS for smooth, Web2-like onboarding and interactions, with Account Abstraction support integrated within a single SDK
- **Particle Network Modular [AA Stack](https://developers.particle.network/landing/realized-vision){target=\_blank}**: Beyond the default EOA-based interactions, Particle also offers a modular AA stack for ERC-4337 account abstraction on Moonbeam, allowing flexibility in the smart account, bundler, and paymaster configurations to suit AA-enabled applications

![Particle Network Smart WaaS map](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/particle-1.webp)

In this guide, you'll go through a step-by-step example of using Particle Connect on Moonbeam.

## Create an Application {: #create-an-application }

To use Particle Connect on Moonbeam, you'll need to create an account on the [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network){target=\_blank} and spin up an application

1. Navigate to the Particle Network dashboard, then sign up or log in

    ![Dashboard login](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/particle-2.webp)

2. Once logged in, click **Add New Project** to create a new project

    ![Project creation](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/particle-3.webp)

3. Enter the project name and click **Save**

    ![Application creation](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/particle-4.webp)

4. From the project's dashboard, scroll down to the **Your Apps** section and create a new app by selecting **iOS**, **Android**, or **Web** and providing the requested information

    ![Application creation](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/particle-5.webp)

5. Finally, copy the **Project ID**, **Client Key**, and **App ID**

    ![Application dashboard](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/particle-6.webp)

## Install Dependencies {: #install-dependencies }

To integrate Particle Connect into your Moonbeam application, you'll need only a few dependencies. Particle Connect offers built-in Account Abstraction (AA) support; however, in this example, we'll install the Particle AA SDK to utilize EIP-1193 providers, such as ethers.


```bash
yarn add @particle-network/connectkit viem@^2 @particle-network/aa ethers
```

> Note that this tutorial is based on a [Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank} with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Configure Particle Connect {: #configure-particle-network }

We’ll configure and initialize Particle Connect (Particle's flagship authentication SDK). Begin by creating a new file called `ConnectKit.tsx` in your project’s root directory, where we’ll set up the `ParticleConnectKit` component as the primary interface for configuration.

Before proceeding, head back to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network){target=\_blank} and retrieve the following API keys:

- **`projectId`** – your project’s unique ID
- **`clientKey`** – your client-specific key
- **`appId`** – your application ID

These keys are essential as they connect your Particle Connect instance with the Particle dashboard, enabling features like no-code customization, user activity tracking, and API request authentication.

Place the API keys in a `.env` file in the following format:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='INSERT_PROJECT_ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY='INSERT_CLIENT_KEY'
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID='INSERT_APP_ID'
```

This setup ensures that your API keys are securely accessible to the Next.js application while protecting them from unauthorized access.

Here’s the code to add to your `ConnectKit.tsx` file:

```js
"use client";

import React from "react";
import { ConnectKitProvider, createConfig } from "@particle-network/connectkit";
import { authWalletConnectors } from "@particle-network/connectkit/auth";
import { moonbeam } from "@particle-network/connectkit/chains";
import { wallet, EntryPosition } from "@particle-network/connectkit/wallet";
import { aa } from "@particle-network/connectkit/aa";

const config = createConfig({
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!,
  clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!,

  walletConnectors: [authWalletConnectors({})],

  plugins: [
    wallet({
      entryPosition: EntryPosition.BR, // Positions the modal button at the bottom right on login
      visible: true, // Determines if the wallet modal is displayed
    }),
    aa({
      name: "SIMPLE",
      version: "2.0.0",
    }),
  ],
  chains: [moonbeam],
});

export const ParticleConnectkit = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => {
  return <ConnectKitProvider config={config}>{children}</ConnectKitProvider>;
};
```

This setup initializes `ParticleConnectKit`, a wrapper for the configured `ConnectKitProvider` instance, using your project keys. It also defines essential SDK settings, such as supported chains (e.g., Moonbeam), wallet positioning and visibility options, and a `SIMPLE` smart account instance.

For further customization options, refer to the [Particle Connect documentation](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/connect/desktop/web#configuration){target=\_blank}.

At this point, you've signed up and created an application, installed all required dependencies, and configured `ParticleConnectKit` and `SmartAccount,` if applicable.

## Integrate the `ParticleConnectKit` Component in Your App {: #integrate-particleconnectkit }

After completing the configuration, wrap your application with the `ParticleConnectKit` component to enable global access to the Particle Connect SDK. Update your `layout.tsx` file in `src` as shown below:

```js
import { ParticleConnectkit } from "@/ConnectKit";
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Particle Connectkit App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <ParticleConnectkit>{children}</ParticleConnectkit>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Wrapping your application in `ParticleConnectKit` provides global access to the SDK, making features like social logins and wallet generation available throughout your app. This setup in `layout.tsx` ensures all components can access Particle Connect’s capabilities.

### Connecting Wallet

With the configured `layout.tsx` file, the next step is to add a central **Connect Wallet** button for user connectivity. You can achieve this by importing `ConnectButton` from `@particle-network/connectkit`. Once the user logs in, the `ConnectButton` transforms into an embedded widget.

```js
"use client";
import { ConnectButton, useAccount } from "@particle-network/connectkit";

const HomePage = () => {
  const { address, isConnected, chainId } = useAccount();

  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen">
      <div className="text-center">
        <ConnectButton />
        {isConnected && (

### Sending transactions with an EIP-1193 provider

Using Particle Connect alongside the Particle AA SDK enables you to work with an EIP-1193 provider like ethers. This approach is beneficial because you're likely already familiar with these providers or if you integrate Particle Connect into an existing application.

To set this up, wrap the smart account provided by Particle Connect with an instance of ethers to create a `customProvider.` You can use ethers as usual from there, with the smart account as the underlying transaction signer.

```js
import {useSmartAccount } from "@particle-network/connectkit";
import { AAWrapProvider, SendTransactionMode } from "@particle-network/aa";

const smartAccount = useSmartAccount();

// Init custom provider with gasless transaction mode
const customProvider = smartAccount
? new ethers.BrowserProvider(
    new AAWrapProvider(
        smartAccount,
        SendTransactionMode.Gasless
    ) as Eip1193Provider,
    "any"
    )
: null;

/**
 * Sends a transaction using the ethers.js library.
 * This transaction is gasless since the customProvider is initialized as gasless
*/
const executeTxEthers = async () => {
    if (!customProvider) return;
  
    const signer = await customProvider.getSigner();
    const tx = {
      to: recipientAddress,
      value: parseEther("0.01").toString(),
    };
  
    const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
    const txReceipt = await txResponse.wait();
    console.log(txReceipt?.hash)
  };
```

## Example of Utilization {: #example-of-utilization }

With those above established, Particle Connect can be used similarly, as shown in the example application below.

Specifically, this application creates a smart account on Moonbeam MainNet through social login, then uses it to send a gasless transaction of 0.001 GLMR with the ethers provider.

```js
"use client";
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

// Particle imports
import {
  ConnectButton,
  useAccount,
  usePublicClient,
  useSmartAccount,
} from "@particle-network/connectkit";

// Eip1193 and AA Provider
import { AAWrapProvider, SendTransactionMode } from "@particle-network/aa"; // Only needed with Eip1193 provider
import { ethers, type Eip1193Provider } from "ethers";
import { formatEther, parseEther } from "viem";

export default function Home() {
  const { isConnected, chain } = useAccount();
  const publicClient = usePublicClient();
  const smartAccount = useSmartAccount();

  const [userAddress, setUserAddress] = useState<string>("");
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [recipientAddress, setRecipientAddress] = useState<string>("");
  const [transactionHash, setTransactionHash] = useState<string | null>(null);

  // Init custom provider with gasless transaction mode
  const customProvider = smartAccount
    ? new ethers.BrowserProvider(
        new AAWrapProvider(
          smartAccount,
          SendTransactionMode.Gasless
        ) as Eip1193Provider,
        "any"
      )
    : null;

  /**
   * Fetches the balance of a given address.
   * @param {string} address - The address to fetch the balance for.
   */
  const fetchBalance = async (address: string) => {
    try {
      const balanceResponse = await publicClient?.getBalance({
        address: address as `0x${string}`,
      });
      if (balanceResponse) {
        const balanceInEther = formatEther(balanceResponse).toString();
        setBalance(balanceInEther);
      } else {
        setBalance("0.0");
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching balance:", error);
      setBalance("0.0");
    }
  };

  /**
   * Loads the user's account data, including address and balance.
   */
  useEffect(() => {
    const loadAccountData = async () => {
      if (isConnected && smartAccount) {
        try {
          const address = await smartAccount.getAddress();
          setUserAddress(address);
          await fetchBalance(address);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error loading account data:", error);
        }
      }
    };
    loadAccountData();
  }, [isConnected, smartAccount]);

  /**
   * Sends a transaction using the ethers.js library.
   * This transaction is gasless since the customProvider is initialized as gasless
   */
  const executeTxEthers = async () => {
    if (!customProvider) return;

    const signer = await customProvider.getSigner();
    try {
      const tx = {
        to: recipientAddress,
        value: parseEther("0.01").toString(),
      };

      const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
      const txReceipt = await txResponse.wait();

      setTransactionHash(txReceipt?.hash || null);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to send transaction using ethers.js:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="container min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-center items-center mx-auto gap-4 px-4 md:px-8">
      <div className="w-full flex justify-center mt-4">

            >
              Send 0.001 {chain?.nativeCurrency.name}
            </button>
            {transactionHash && (
              <p className="text-green-500 mt-4">
                Transaction Hash: {transactionHash}
              </p>
            )}
          </div>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Integrate RainbowKit into a DApp

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction){target=\_blank} is a React library that adds wallet connection capabilities to a dApp. It supports numerous wallets and enables features such as switching connection chains, ENS address resolution, and balance display out-of-the-box. RainbowKit offers customization options for all EVM-compatible chains, making it possible to easily connect mobile wallets to your Moonbeam dApps.

RainbowKit bundles together multiple tools to simplify adding wallet connection to your dApp: 

- [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/){target=\_blank} - a React Hooks library for interacting with Ethereum accounts, wallets, contracts, transactions, signing, ENS, and more
- [viem](https://viem.sh/){target=\_blank} - TypeScript interface which provides low-level stateless primitives for interacting with Ethereum
- [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/){target=\_blank} - adds encrypted connections and enhanced UX experiences like connecting a mobile wallet by scanning a QR code
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview){target=\_blank} - helps manage and update server state within the application

This guide takes you through adding RainbowKit to a dApp using the CLI, adding support for Moonbeam networks, and some options for further customizing your integration.

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

If you are starting a new project, RainbowKit can scaffold a project from the CLI, combining RainbowKit and Wagmi in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs){target=\_blank} application. Use your package manager of choice to run the CLI command and start your project:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest 
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
    ```
=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
    ```

The script will prompt you for a project name, generate a new directory with the boilerplate starter code, and install all required dependencies. 

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
</span>
    <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt=""> 🌈 Welcome to RainbowKit!</span>
    <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt="✔ What is the name of your project?"> rainbow-demo</span>
    <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt=""> 🚀 Creating a new RainbowKit app in /Users/dawnkelly/Documents/papermoon_builds/RainbowKit/add-rainbow-kit/rainbow-demo</span>
    <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt=""> 📦 Installing dependencies with npm. This could take a while.</span>
    <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt="">📚 Initializing git repository</span>
    <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt=""> 🌈 Done! Thanks for using RainbowKit 🙏</span>
    <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt=""> 👉 To get started, run cd rainbow-demo and then npm run dev</span>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

You can now navigate to the project directory, start the development server, and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your project locally:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    npm run dev 
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    pnpm run dev
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    yarn dev
    ```

Your starting screen should look like this:

![Scaffolded RainbowKit project landing page](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/rainbowkit/rainbowkit-1.webp)

Open the project in your code editor and take a look at the directory and file structure, making note of the `wagmi.ts` file. This file is where you can customize which chains to include in the list of networks users can connect to through your dApp. 

Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha are not on the list of default supported networks. You can customize your dApp's supported networks in the `wagmi.ts` file by updating the chain entrypoints imported from `wagmi/chains` and passed to the `chains` property when `config` is defined. Wagmi uses [chain definitions](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/chains#available-chains) established by viem, primarily the chain name. The `wagmi/chains` names for Moonbeam networks are as follows: 

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```js
    moonbeam
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```js
    moonriver
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```js
    moonbaseAlpha
    ```

To add support for Moonbeam networks, update `wagmi.ts` as follows. You will learn how to generate the `projectId` value in the next section. 

```js title="src/wagmi.ts"

import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';
import { getDefaultConfig, RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { moonbeam, moonriver, moonbaseAlpha } from 'wagmi/chains';
import { QueryClientProvider, QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'My Moonbeam App',
  projectId: 'process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID',
  chains: [moonbeam, moonriver, moonbaseAlpha],
  ssr: true,
});

```
## Manual Setup 

If you want to add RainbowKit to an existing React application, you can complete a manual setup. The following sections will guide you through using the manual setup to install and import needed dependencies, configure chain connections to support Moonbeam networks, and make RainbowKit functionality available to users of your dApp. You will also learn how to specify which chain the **Connect Wallet** button should connect to by default and how to customize the RainbowKit theme to fit your project.

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

The following guide assumes you have:

- An existing dApp built with [React](https://react.dev/){target=\_blank} and you want to use the manual setup to connect to a mobile wallet via RainbowKit

    - The [RainbowKit examples repository](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples){target=\_blank} includes templates for multiple React frameworks
    
    - To follow this guide, visit [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs){target=\_blank} and follow the **Automatic Installation** instructions, selecting Typescript and the App Router options during setup 

- A mobile wallet which supports Moonbeam out of the box or allows for adding custom networks

- A WalletConnect `projectId` - every dApp relying on WalletConnect is required to have an associated `projectId`. It is free to create an account, and you can instantly generate an ID

To obtain a WalletConnect `projectId`:

1. Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/){target=\_blank}
2. On the **Projects** page, select **Create** 
3. Add your project information (you can leave **Homepage URL** blank if you have not deployed your dApp)
4. Select the **AppKit** SDK
5. Select your coding environment or platform (select React for this guide)
6. Locate your `projectId` in the left menu. You can also find it in the **Get started** code snippet of the WalletConnect Quickstart
 
### Getting Started {: #getting-started }

Ensure you are in the root directory for your project, then install RainbowKit and its peer dependencies:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```

Next, start the development server to create a local dApp instance:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

If you navigate to `http://localhost:3000`,  you should see the starter Next.js application in your browser.

To test the RainbowKit connection, you will use the MetaMask mobile app. To follow this guide, you must have established a connection to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet on the MetaMask mobile app.

You can connect your MetaMask mobile wallet to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet in a couple of ways. You can manually add the Moonbase Alpha TestNet configurations from the **Networks** section of the **Settings** menu. Or you can also open up the **Browser** from MetaMask mobile and navigate to the [Moonbeam documentation site (docs.moonbeam.network)](/){target=\_blank}, click on **Connect MetaMask** at the top of the page, and select **Moonbase Alpha** from the menu. Follow the prompts to automatically add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network.

Next, safely add your `projectId` to your application: 

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project

    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```

2. Add your `projectId` to this file

    ```text title=".env.local"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='INSERT_PROJECT_ID'
    ```

3. Locate your `.gitignore` file in this same directory and ensure `.env*.local` is included in the list of files to ignore. This will prevent committing your `projectId` to GitHub

In the next section, you will use this stored `projectId` when setting up the `wagmi` config.

### Connect DApp to MetaMask Mobile {: #connect-dapp-to-metamask-mobile }

In the next sections, you will complete the steps needed to use RainbowKit to connect your dApp to MetaMask's mobile wallet:

1. Import RainbowKit, Wagmi, and TanStack Query
2. Setup configuration for Wagmi
3. Wrap your application with providers
4. Add the connect button

### Import RainbowKit, Wagmi, and TanStack Query

Ensure you are still in your project's root directory, then create a new file called `wagmi.ts`. This file will contain the imports and configuration needed to connect your dApp to mobile wallets and interact with blockchains. 

```bash
touch wagmi.ts
```

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```js
    moonbeam
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```js
    moonriver
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```js
    moonbaseAlpha
    ```

Add the `wagmi/chains` import with `moonbeam`, `moonriver`, and `moonbaseAlpha` as the supported chains. 

```ts title="wagmi.ts"
import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';
import { getDefaultConfig, RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { moonbeam, moonriver, moonbaseAlpha } from 'wagmi/chains';
import { QueryClientProvider, QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'My Moonbeam App',
  projectId: 'process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID',
  chains: [moonbeam, moonriver, moonbaseAlpha],
  ssr: true,
});
```

Now, setup the `config` to include Moonbeam networks by ensuring the `chains` array matches the list of chains in the `import` statement. Finally, update the `projectId` value to use the one stored in your `.env.local` file.

```ts title="wagmi.ts"
export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'My Moonbeam App',
  projectId: 'process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID',
  chains: [moonbeam, moonriver, moonbaseAlpha],
  ssr: true,
});
```

### Wrap Your Application with Providers

With the configuration in place, the next step is to wrap your application with the `RainbowKitProvider`, `WagmiProvider`, and `QueryClientProvider` to make them available throughout your dApp. In your terminal, navigate to the `app` directory in your project and create a file named `providers.tsx`:

```bash
cd app &&
touch providers.tsx
```

Open `providers.tsx` and add the following code to define `Providers`:

```ts title="providers.tsx"
'use client';

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { config } from '../wagmi';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <RainbowKitProvider>{children}</RainbowKitProvider>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

Now locate the `layout.tsx` file inside the `app` directory and modify the code to import `Providers` and wrap the application:

```ts title="layout.tsx"
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
import './globals.css';
import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';
import { Providers } from './providers';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Moonbeam dApp',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Wrapping the application in the providers makes the functionalities of RainbowKit, Wagmi, and TanStack Query available throughout your dApp. This setup gives you the flexibility to add a wallet connection button anywhere in your project. 

### Add the Connect Button

RainbowKit offers a `ConnectButton` component, which renders the **Connect** and **Disconnect** buttons and UI elements for switching chains. This example imports the `ConnectButton` into the existing `page.tsx` file for simplicity, but you may want to add it to an element like a **Header** or **Navbar** so it appears at the top of each page. Update the code in `page.tsx` as follows:

```ts title="page.tsx"
import Image from 'next/image';
import styles from './page.module.css';
import { ConnectButton } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.main}>
      <ConnectButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you haven't already, start the development server and spin up a local version of your dApp. Your home page should now include a visible **Connect Wallet** button. Click the button to test the connection. You should now see the RainbowKit modal with options to get or connect a wallet. Select **MetaMask** and follow the prompts to connect your wallet.

The current configuration defaults to connecting to Moonbeam and displaying the current network, native token balance, an ENS or fallback avatar, and the connected wallet address. Select the arrow next to **Moonbeam** to open the **Switch Networks** modal. Select **Moonbase Alpha** and sign the MetaMask transaction to authorize switching networks. You should now see **Moonbase Alpha** listed as the connected network with your DEV token balance, avatar, and account number displayed. 

## Customize Rainbow Kit

Not only does RainbowKit abstract away the complexities of managing wallet connections, but the library offers several options for customizing UI and functionality to meet the needs of your dApp. You can find a complete list of customization options in the RainbowKit [documentation](https://rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction){target=\_blank}. This section covers customizing the **Connect Wallet** button to connect initially to Moonbase Alpha and render it in a custom color. 

### Set Custom Initial Chain

RainbowKit will connect by default to the first chain supplied to Wagmi in the config. If you compare the order of chains listed in `wagmi.ts` to those on the **Switch Networks** modal, you will see they are the same. If you wanted to always connect to the TestNet first, a simple fix would be to move `moonbaseAlpha` to the top of the chain list. However, assuming this default behavior will never change is not the most reliable option. 

Instead, you can use the `initialChain` prop that is part of the `RainbowKitProvider` element to define which chain the wallet should initially connect to when the user selects **Connect Wallet**. Open your `providers.tsx` file and update the code to configure the `initialChain` prop. You can pass either a chain ID or chain name from the [Wagmi Chains list](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/chains){target=\_blank}.

### Define Custom Theme Colors

RainbowKit offers three built-in theme functions: `lightTheme`, `darkTheme`, and `midnightTheme`. These theme functions return a theme object, which you can pass into the `RainbowKitProvider` prop `theme` to set custom colors, border radius, font stack, and overlay blur. Update `providers.tsx` with the following code. Be sure to add `darkTheme` to the `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`import statement to allow your changes to render correctly. After customizing the initial chain and theme, your `providers.tsx` file should look like the following:

```js title="providers.tsx"
'use client';

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { RainbowKitProvider, darkTheme } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { config } from '../wagmi';
import { moonbaseAlpha } from 'viem/chains';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <RainbowKitProvider
          initialChain={moonbaseAlpha}
          theme={darkTheme({
            accentColor: '#958fdc',
            accentColorForeground: 'white',
          })}
        >
          {children}
        </RainbowKitProvider>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

## Handle Disconnections

You can now disconnect MetaMask from your dApp and then reconnect to test your customizations. There are two options for completing this step.  

### Disconnect from DApp {: #disconnect-from-dapp }

RainbowKit includes a **Disconnect** button out of the box. To open the modal, select the arrow next to your account number. Click the **Disconnect** button. You should now see **Connect Wallet**; your account information should no longer be visible. 

![Built in Disconnect button](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/rainbowkit/rainbowkit-2.webp)

### Disconnect from MetaMask Mobile {: #disconnect-from-metamask-mobile }

Some users prefer to disconnect from their mobile wallet rather than use a button within a dApp. To use this method: 

1. Select the MetaMask extension in your browser to open the modal
2. Select the three dots in the upper right corner of the MetaMask modal
3. Select **Connected sites**
4. Review the list of sites connected to your wallet
5. Select **Disconnect** for each site you want to disconnect

## Final Result {: #final-result }

The **Connect Wallet** button on your home page should now render in the color you entered for `accentColor` when customizing the theme. When you click **Connect Wallet**, you will see the same accent color in use. Select MetaMask and sign the transaction to authorize the connection. You should now see **Moonbase Alpha** as the connected network and your DEV token balance for the account balance without manually switching networks.

# Integrate WalletConnect into a DApp

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com){target=\_blank} is an open protocol to communicate securely between wallets and DApps.

WalletConnect establishes a remote connection between a DApp and mobile wallet by using a bridge server to relay payloads. The connection is initiated via a QR code displayed in a DApp, which will need to be scanned and approved by a mobile wallet. When a connection is established, the payloads between the DApp and wallet are encrypted through a shared key.

![WalletConnect flow](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/walletconnect/walletconnect-1.webp)

WalletConnect can also be used to establish a connection between a DApp and a desktop wallet. However, this guide will only cover a mobile wallet connection.

In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate WalletConnect into a simple DApp built on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. The guide will be divided into a few different sections. The first section will cover connecting your DApp to MetaMask mobile. After the connection has been established, the guide will cover disconnections. This way, when you are testing your DApp you will be able to connect and then disconnect so you don't end up with a bunch of unnecessary WalletConnect sessions lingering in MetaMask mobile. Afterwards you will learn how to display network and account details when connected, and send transactions from your DApp to MetaMask mobile for confirmation.

This guide is an adaptation of the [WalletConnect Example Dapp](https://example.walletconnect.org){target=\_blank} ([source code](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-example-dapp){target=\_blank}). To view the end result, you can check out the [Moonbeam WalletConnect Demo app](https://moonbeam-walletconnect-demo.netlify.app){target=\_blank} ([source code](https://github.com/papermoonio/moonbeam-walletconnect-demo){target=\_blank}).

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

If you already have a DApp with WalletConnect support, and just want to add Moonbeam support, you can use the following network configurations:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```js
    {
      name: "Moonbeam",
      short_name: "moonbeam",
      chain: "Moonbeam",
      network: "mainnet",
      chain_id: {{ networks.moonbeam.chain_id }},
      network_id: {{ networks.moonbeam.chain_id }},
      rpc_url: "{{ networks.moonbeam.public_rpc_url }}",
      native_currency: {
        symbol: "GLMR",
        name: "Glimmer",
        decimals: "18",
        contractAddress: "",
        balance: "",
      },
    },
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```js
    {
      name: "Moonriver",
      short_name: "moonriver",
      chain: "Moonriver",
      network: "mainnet",
      chain_id: {{ networks.moonriver.chain_id }},
      network_id: {{ networks.moonriver.chain_id }},
      rpc_url: "{{ networks.moonriver.public_rpc_url }}",
      native_currency: {
        symbol: "MOVR",
        name: "Moonriver",
        decimals: "18",
        contractAddress: "",
        balance: "",
      },
    },
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```js
    {
      name: "Moonbase Alpha",
      short_name: "moonbase",
      chain: "Moonbase",
      network: "testnet",
      chain_id: {{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }},
      network_id: {{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }},
      rpc_url: "{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}",
      native_currency: {
        symbol: "DEV",
        name: "DEV",
        decimals: "18",
        contractAddress: "",
        balance: "",
      },
    },
    ```

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

Throughout this guide, you'll use a simple front-end dApp built with [React](https://react.dev){target=\_blank} to connect to a mobile wallet via WalletConnect. So, you will need a React project and the MetaMask mobile app installed for testing purposes. A template has been created that includes the required packages, some basic styling, and placeholders where logic and UI elements must be added. However, if you would like to use your own dApp, you'll need to install the following required dependencies:

```bash
npm install ethers @walletconnect/client @walletconnect/qrcode-modal
```

This guide will use MetaMask mobile for testing purposes. To install MetaMask mobile, you can go to [metamask.io/download/](https://metamask.io/download){target=\_blank} and switch to either the **iOS** or **Android** tab.

Lastly, you will need to have an account funded with DEV tokens, so that you can test out sending a transaction.
 You can get DEV tokens for testing on Moonbase Alpha once every 24 hours from the [Moonbase Alpha Faucet](https://faucet.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}.

## Getting Started {: #getting-started }

To get started quickly with the Moonbeam WalletConnect template, which provides everything you need to dive right in, you'll need to take the following steps:

1. Clone the [walletconnect-template GitHub repository](https://github.com/papermoonio/moonbeam-walletconnect-template){target=\_blank}
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to spin up a local instance of the DApp

To test the WalletConnect connection, you can use the MetaMask mobile app. For the purposes of this guide, you will need to already be connected to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet on the MetaMask mobile app. Later on in the guide, you will learn how to check if the connected network is a supported network, and if not display an error that will suggest users to switch to a network that is supported.

There are a couple of ways you can connect your MetaMask mobile wallet to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. You can manually add the Moonbase Alpha TestNet configurations from the **Networks** section of the **Settings** menu. Or you can also open up the **Browser** from MetaMask mobile and navigate to [docs.moonbeam.network](/){target=\_blank}, click on **Connect MetaMask** at the top of the page, and select **Moonbase Alpha** from the menu. This will prompt you to automatically add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network and saves you from inputting the network configurations manually.

## Connect DApp to MetaMask Mobile {: #connect-dapp-to-metamask-mobile }

In this section, you will learn how to make a connection between your DApp and MetaMask mobile. WalletConnect establishes a remote connection between a DApp and mobile wallet by using a bridge server to relay payloads. The connection is initiated via a QR code displayed in the DApp, which will need to be scanned and approved by the mobile wallet.

To get started, you can open up the [`App.js` file of the template](https://github.com/papermoonio/moonbeam-walletconnect-template/blob/main/src/App.js){target=\_blank} and the first changes will be made within the `connect` function. This function will handle the connection logic by creating a new instance of the WalletConnect connector. You'll notice that the `setFetching` state hook is already in place. This will be used to set the `fetching` state variable to `true` while the connection is being established. In general the `connect` function will:

1. Create the WalletConnect Connector and pass in the URL for the bridge server and the WalletConnect QR code modal
2. Use the `setConnector` state hook to update the `connector` state variable
3. Check if the connection has been established, and if not create a new session request

```js
const connect = async () => {
  setFetching(true);

  // 1. Create connector
  const connector = new WalletConnect({
    bridge: 'https://bridge.walletconnect.org',
    qrcodeModal: QRCodeModal,
  });

  // 2. Update the connector state
  setConnector(connector);

  // 3. If not connected, create a new session
  if (!connector.connected) {
    await connector.createSession();
  }
};
```

Now that you have the `connect` function setup, you can create a **Connect Wallet** button that will call it `onClick`. You can replace the `{/* buttons and network details will go here */}` comment in the [template](https://github.com/papermoonio/moonbeam-walletconnect-template/blob/main/src/App.js#L124){target=\_blank} with the following button:

```js
<Button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</Button>
```

To test out the code so far, if you haven't already you can run `npm start` to spin up a local instance of your DApp. Then click on **Connect Wallet**. The WalletConnect QR code modal will pop-up.

![Scan QR code from DApp](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/walletconnect/walletconnect-2.webp)

To establish the connection from MetaMask mobile, you can:

1. Click on the scan icon in the top right corner and scan the QR code
2. A window will pop-up at the bottom of the screen and prompt you to connect to the DApp. Click **Connect**
3. If you were able to successfully connect, you will see a pop-up in MetaMask that says **Connected to Moonbeam WalletConnect Demo App**

![Connect WalletConnect on MetaMask mobile](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/walletconnect/walletconnect-3.webp)

Currently, your DApp will still show the **Connect Wallet** button, so the next step will be to display a **Disconnect** button when connected instead. 

## Handle Disconnections

When you're developing your DApp and the WalletConnect integration, it is important to handle disconnections so that you can properly test the flow of the integration. You also don't want to end up with a bunch of lingering WalletConnect sessions within MetaMask mobile.

If at any time, you need to manually end a session, you can do so from MetaMask mobile by naivgating to **Settings** and take the following steps:

1. Select **Experimental**
2. Under **WalletConnect Sessions**, tap on **View Sessions**
3. To remove a specific session, you can hold down on the session
4. A pop-up will appear at the bottom of the screen where you can then tap **End**.

![End WalletConnect Session on MetaMask mobile](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/walletconnect/walletconnect-4.webp)

Although this is important for development, this way of disconnecting a session can also be done by a user. The next couple of sections will cover the logic for how to handle disconnections from your DApp and from MetaMask mobile.

### Disconnect from DApp {: #disconnect-from-dapp }

To make it easy for users, your DApp should have a **Disconnect** button that will end the active session on their mobile wallet. First you can create the logic and then you can create the button.

Upon disconnecting, you will need to reset the state of your DApp back to the initial state. To reset the state, you can create a `resetApp` function that uses the state hooks.

```js
const resetApp = () => {
  setConnector(null);
  setFetching(false);
};
```

In addition to resetting the state of the DApp, you will also need to kill the session using the `connector` and the WalletConnect `killSession` function. Since all of this functionality should happen when the user clicks on the **Disconnect** button, you can create a single `killSession` function to handle the reset and the disconnection.

```js
const killSession = () => {
  // Make sure the connector exists before trying to kill the session
  if (connector) {
    connector.killSession();
  }
  resetApp();
};
```

Now that you have all of the logic required to handle the disconnection, you will need the **Disconnect** button that `onClick` will call the `killSession` function. Since you only want to display the **Disconnect** button once a user is connected, you can use [conditional rendering](https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering){target=\_blank}. Conditional rendering allows you to check against certain variables and if a condition applies you can render one element or another. In this case, if you are not fetching the initial connection and the connector exists, you can render the **Disconnect** button, otherwise render the **Connect Wallet** button. You can replace the existing `<Button>` with the following:

```js
{
  connector && !fetching ? (
    <OutlinedButton onClick={killSession}>Disconnect</OutlinedButton>
  ) : (
    <Button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</Button>
  );
}
```

If you go to test the disconnection logic and nothing happens when you click **Connect Wallet**, make sure you have manually ended any preexisting sessions from MetaMask mobile. If you're still running into problems, do a hard refresh on your browser.

Now when a user clicks on **Disconnect** the DApp will be reset, the connection will be disconnected on the user's mobile wallet, and the **Connect Wallet** button will be displayed again.

### Disconnect from MetaMask Mobile {: #disconnect-from-metamask-mobile }

As previously mentioned, a user can also disconnect and end the session from within their mobile wallet. If this happens, WalletConnect emits a `disconnect` event that the DApp will need to listen for. Upon receiving the `disconnect` event, the state will need to be reset back to the initial state. In this scenario, there is no reason to use `killSession` to end the session on the mobile wallet as the user has already ended the session on their mobile wallet.

You'll notice that in the template, the `disconnect` event is listened for within the [React Effect Hook](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects){target=\_blank}. The effect hook lets you perform side effects in function components such as fetching data and setting up a subscription.

In the `disconnect` event callback, you can add the `resetApp` function so that whenever a `disconnect` event is emitted, you reset the state of your DApp. 

```js
connector.on('disconnect', async (error) => {
  if (error) {
    // Handle errors as you see fit
    console.error(error);
  }
  resetApp();
});
```

So far you've setup the minimum logic required for connecting and disconnecting your DApp and the MetaMask mobile app. When the connection has been established, a **Disconnect** button is now displayed. In the next section, you'll expand on what is displayed when connected to include account and network details.

## Check Network Support & Display Results {: #check-network-support-display-result }

With the basics of connecting and disconnecting out of the way, you can expand on what is displayed in the DApp when a user is connected. The first thing you'll want to do is check if the network they are on is supported and if not display a message that requests them to switch the network.

The template comes with a list of supported networks, you can find it under [`src/helpers/networks.js`](https://github.com/papermoonio/moonbeam-walletconnect-template/blob/main/src/helpers/networks.js){target=\_blank}. For the purposes of this guide, Moonbase Alpha is the only one that you'll be testing but you can feel free to uncomment the Moonbeam and Moonriver network configurations and add additional networks as needed.

You can add the logic to check if the connected network is supported to the `onConnect` function. The `onConnect` function is called anytime a `connect` event is emitted. If the user is connected to a supported network, you can display network details such as the chain ID, network name, and more. You can add the following state variables and hooks:

```js
const [account, setAccount] = useState(null);
const [chainId, setChainId] = useState(null);
const [supported, setSupported] = useState(false);
const [network, setNetwork] = useState(null);
const [symbol, setSymbol] = useState(null);
```

Make sure that you also add these state hooks in the `resetApp` function, so that all of the state variables can be reset to their initial state. 

You'll notice that the `onConnect` function already accepts two parameters: the connected chain ID and account. You can set the state variables for the `chainId` and `account` then check to see if the network is supported. You'll use the chain ID to see if the network exists in the list of supported networks. If it does, you can use the `setSupported` state hook to set the state to `true`, and if not set it to `false`.

```js
const onConnect = async (chainId, connectedAccount) => {
  setAccount(connectedAccount);
  setChainId(chainId);

  // get chain data
  const networkData = SUPPORTED_NETWORKS.filter(
    (chain) => chain.chain_id === chainId
  )[0];

  if (!networkData) {
    setSupported(false);
  } else {
    setSupported(true);
    // set additional network data here
  }
};
```

If the network does exist in the list of supported networks, you can then save additional network name and symbol. The symbol will be used later on to display the connected account's balance.

You can replace the `// set additional network data here` comment with the following:

```js
setNetwork(networkData.name);
setSymbol(networkData.native_currency.symbol);
```

You will also need to update the `useEffect` dependency array to include the `chainId` and `account` state variables so that it re-renders with any changes to either variable.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  ...
}, [connector, chainId, account]);
```

Then to render these state variables on the page, you can include additional UI elements alongside the **Disconnect** button. Again, you can use conditional rendering to display specific details or an error message if the network is supported or not.

```js
{
  connector && !fetching ? (
    <LoadedData>
      <Data>
        <strong>Connected Account: </strong>
        {account}
      </Data>
      <Data>
        <strong>Chain ID: </strong>
        {chainId}
      </Data>
      {supported ? (
        <>
          <Data>
            <strong>Network: </strong>
            {network}
          </Data>
        </>
      ) : (
        <strong>
          Network not supported. Please disconnect, switch networks, and connect
          again.
        </strong>
      )}
      <OutlinedButton onClick={killSession}>Disconnect</OutlinedButton>
    </LoadedData>
  ) : (
    <Button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</Button>
  );
}
```

You can adapt the above code snippet as needed to provide better error handling.

## Refresh Data {: #refresh-data }

While you're developing the DApp, you'll want to handle page refreshes and update the data as needed based on the WalletConnect connection. Otherwise, you might find yourself manually disconnecting from MetaMask mobile more often then not.

The template already has a `refreshData` function, it just needs to be called under certain circumstances. If the `connector` exists and is connected, but the `chainId` or `account` doesn't you should call the `refreshData` function and use the `connector` configurations to update state and re-render the variables on the page.

You can replace the `// check state variables here & if needed refresh the app` [comment](https://github.com/papermoonio/moonbeam-walletconnect-template/blob/main/src/App.js#L84){target=\_blank} with the following:

```js
// If any of these variables do not exist and the connector is connected, refresh the data
if ((!chainId || !account) && connector.connected) {
  refreshData();
}
```

You can test this logic out by refreshing the page after establishing a connection. Instead of defaulting to the **Connect Wallet** button, you'll see that the account and network details, and the **Disconnect** button are displayed.

## Add Account Balance {: #add-account-balance }

Depending on your needs, you might want to show the connected account's balance for the connected network. To do so, you can use [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v6){target=\_blank} to create a provider which can then be used to fetch the balance of the connected account.

You can start by adding another state variable for `balance`.

```js
const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null);
```

Make sure that you add this state hook in the `resetApp` function, and use it to reset the balance variable to its initial state.

For simplicity, you can add the logic for fetching the account balance and saving it to state directly in the `onConnect` function. You will need to:

1. Create an Ethers provider by passing in the network's RPC url, chain ID, and name
2. Use the provider to call `getBalance`, which will return the balance as a `BigNumber`
3. Convert the `BigNumber` representation of the balance to a string representation of the balance in Ether
4. Use the `setBalance` state hook to save the balance to state

```js
const onConnect = async (chainId, address) => {
  setAccount(address);

  const networkData = SUPPORTED_NETWORKS.filter(
    (network) => network.chain_id === chainId
  )[0];

  if (!networkData) {
    setSupported(false);
  } else {
    setSupported(true);
    setNetwork(networkData.name);
    setSymbol(networkData.native_currency.symbol);
    setChainId(chainId);

    // 1. Create an Ethers provider
    const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(networkData.rpc_url, {
      chainId,
      name: networkData.name,
    });

    // 2. Get the account balance
    const balance = await provider.getBalance(address);
    // 3. Format the balance
    const formattedBalance = ethers.formatEther(balance);
    // 4. Save the balance to state
    setBalance(formattedBalance);
  }
};
```

You will need to add the `balance` state variable to the `useEffect` dependency array alongside the `connector`, `chainId`, and `account` variables.

You can also use the `balance` state variable to refresh the data on the page.

```js
// If any of these variables do not exist and the connector is connected, refresh the data
if ((!chainId || !account || !balance) && connector.connected) {
  refreshData();
}
```

Finally, you can display the account balance if the user is connected to a supported network. You can use the `symbol` state variable that was created earlier on in the guide to show the balance in **DEV** for Moonbase Alpha.

```js
{
  supported ? (
    <>
      <Data>
        <strong>Network: </strong>
        {network}
      </Data>
      <Data>
        <strong>Balance: </strong>
        {balance} {symbol}
      </Data>
    </>
  ) : (
    <strong>
      Network not supported. Please disconnect, switch networks, and connect
      again.
    </strong>
  );
}
```

This example can be adapted to retrieve other data from Ethers as needed.

## Send a Transaction {: #send-a-transaction }

To truly take advantage of the value that WalletConnect provides, you can send a transaction which will be initiated from within your DApp and then confirmed and signed from MetaMask mobile.

To get started, you will need to update the `sendTransaction` function that has already been created in the template. The function will use the WalletConnect `connector` to send a transaction. For example purposes, you can send 2 DEV tokens on Moonbase Alpha to your own account.

```js
const sendTransaction = async () => {
  try {
    await connector.sendTransaction({
      from: account,
      to: account,
      value: '0x1BC16D674EC80000',
    });
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle the error as you see fit
    console.error(e);
  }
};
```

To initiate the transaction from the DApp, you will need to create a button, that `onClick` calls the `sendTransaction` function. This should only be done if the connected network is a supported network.

```js
{
  supported ? (
    <>
      <Data>
        <strong>Network: </strong>
        {network}
      </Data>
      <Data>
        <strong>Balance: </strong>
        {balance} {symbol}
      </Data>
      <OutlinedButton onClick={sendTransaction}>
        Send Transaction
      </OutlinedButton>
    </>
  ) : (
    <strong>
      Network not supported. Please disconnect, switch networks, and connect
      again.
    </strong>
  );
}
```

When you click on **Send Transaction**, a pop-up will appear in MetaMask mobile with the transaction details:

1. To sign and send the transaction, you can click on **Confirm**
2. If successful you should see a notification in the MetaMask mobile app

![Send Transaction](/images/builders/integrations/wallets/walletconnect/walletconnect-5.webp)

You can also confirm the transaction went through by searching for your account in a block explorer such as [Moonscan](https://moonbase.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}.

## Additional Considerations {: #additional-considerations }

This guide covers the basics for setting up a WalletConnect connection, but there are many ways in which you can improve the experience for your users or yourself as you develop the integration. You might want to consider adding in support for the following items:

- Adding a loader for when your transaction is waiting to be confirmed or a message that informs your users to check their mobile wallet and confirm the transaction from there
- Adding notifications on your DApp for the status of sent transactions
- Adding appropriate error handling
- Adding in logic to automatically update your users balances

# Interacting with Moonbeam Using Coinbase Wallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/?_branch_match_id=977295450874474909&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXT8%2FXS07SLddLzs%2FVD8%2FJynFKSy02zE4CAFZ0JzQfAAAA){target=\_blank} is a self-custody (non-custodial) wallet, like [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}, available as a mobile application for iOS and Android and a browser extension. You can use Coinbase Wallet to interact with Moonbeam, Moonriver, and the Moonbase Alpha TestNet after adding them as custom networks.

Please note that Coinbase Wallet is an entirely different product from Coinbase Exchange, a custodial platform for buying and selling cryptocurrency. Holding a token in your Coinbase Wallet does not imply it is supported on Coinbase Exchange. If you send a token from your Coinbase Wallet to Coinbase Exchange that is not supported by the exchange, you will lose those funds forever.

In this guide, you'll go through the process of setting up the Coinbase Wallet mobile application and browser extension and configuring it for the Moonbeam network.

## Install Coinbase Wallet {: #install-coinbase-wallet }

You can [download Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/?_branch_match_id=977295450874474909&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXT8%2FXS07SLddLzs%2FVD8%2FJynFKSy02zE4CAFZ0JzQfAAAA){target=\_blank} as a mobile app from the iOS App Store or Google Play Store, or as a desktop browser extension from the Chrome Store.

The interfaces for the mobile app and browser extension are quite similar, so you can adapt the following instructions for the browser extension. The one major difference between the two is that when you add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network, you can interact with the network on the browser extension but not from the mobile app. This difference only applies to Moonbase Alpha. If you're connecting to Moonbeam or Moonriver, you'll be able to interact with either network from both the browser extension and mobile app.

## Create a Wallet {: #create-a-wallet }

After installing and opening the app, you'll be greeted with the option to create a new wallet or import an existing one. For this exercise, set up a new wallet by tapping **Create a new wallet**.

You'll be prompted to create a passcode, and once you've entered in your passcode, you'll need to verify it by entering it again a second time.

![Create an account on the Coinbase Wallet mobile app.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-1.webp)

Once you've created your passcode, your wallet will be created. The last step to take is to secure your account by backing up your wallet's recovery phrase. To back up your wallet, you can take the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** screen
2. Choose **Security** from the menu
3. Tap on your wallet that you want to back up; it should say **Not backed up** next to it
4. Enter your passcode
5. Select how you want to back up your recovery phrase: make an encrypted backup of the seed phrase to iCloud (iOS) or Google Drive (Android), save the phrase manually, or do both. If you are backing up your phrase to the iCloud or Google Drive, you'll have to create a password that will secure your phrase in the cloud. **This password cannot be reset, so you'll need to keep it safe**. If you are manually saving your phrase, make sure you store it exactly as displayed and save it in a secure location
6. When you're done, click **Complete backup**

![Back up your wallet's recovery phrase through the settings menu.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-2.webp)

!!! note
    If you're using the browser extension, you'll follow a slightly different flow, as you'll be prompted to back up your wallet right away, and you'll only have the option to manually do this.

Congratulations! You've completed the setup steps, and your wallet is now fully initialized. In the next step, you'll see how you can connect Coinbase Wallet to the Moonbeam network.

### Connect Coinbase Wallet to Moonbeam {: #connect-coinbase-to-moonbeam }

Although Coinbase Wallet has a built-in browser, it doesn't currently support automatically adding custom networks, so you'll have to add the network details manually. To do so, perform the following steps:

 1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab
 2. Tap on **Networks**
 3. Tap on the **+** icon in the upper right corner
 4. Here, you can fill in the network details for Moonbeam, Moonriver, or the Moonbase Alpha TestNet

        |         Variable          |                                      Value                                       |
        |:-------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
        |       Network Name        |                                 `Moonbase Alpha`                                 |
        |          RPC URL          |                        `{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}`                         |
        |          ChainID          | `{{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }}` (hex: `{{ networks.moonbase.hex_chain_id }}`) |
        |     Symbol (Optional)     |                                      `DEV`                                       |
        | Block Explorer (Optional) |                     `{{ networks.moonbase.block_explorer }}`                     |

 5. Press **Add Network** once finished

![Add Moonbeam as a custom network through the network settings.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-3.webp)

After returning to the **Networks** screen, you can view the newly added network from the **Custom** tab. To interact with Moonbeam, you'll need to mark the network as **Active** by taking the following steps:

1. Tap on **Moonbeam**
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and toggle the **Active network** switch to on
3. Tap **Save**

![Set Moonbeam as the active network.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-4.webp)

### Receiving Funds {: #receiving-funds }

To view and manage your assets, you can click on **Assets** from the bottom navigation menu.

Since you created a new wallet in this demo, the app displays a balance of `$0.00` and doesn't list any assets in the **Crypto** tab. You can change this by sending some GLMR to this account. To send funds to your Coinbase Wallet account, take the following steps:

 1. Tap on **Receive**
 2. Tap on the QR code icon or the copy icon next to **Ethereum address**. Since Moonbeam is Ethereum-compatible, you can use the Ethereum account it provides you with on Moonbeam

![Copy your Ethereum address so you can receive funds.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-5.webp)

Now that you have your receiving address, you can send assets to it. To view your assets once they arrive, you'll need to make sure that you've activated the correct network from the network's configuration screen in the **Networks** settings, as outlined in the [previous section](#connect-coinbase-to-moonbeam).

### Sending Funds {: #sending-funds }

To send funds from your Coinbase Wallet, navigate to the **Assets** tab, then take the following steps:

 1. Tap **Send**
 2. On the next screen, enter the amount of the asset you'd like to send
 3. Tap **Next**
 4. Enter the address you'd like to send it to
 5. Tap **Confirm** to continue
 6. Review the transaction details to ensure accuracy, then press **Send**
 7. Upon successfully sending the transaction, you can tap **Done**

![Send funds.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-6.webp)

From the **Transactions** tab, you'll be able to see your outgoing transactions, including the address you sent the transaction to, the status of the transaction, and the amount you sent. You can tap on each transaction to find out more information.

![View your transaction history from the transactions screen.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-7.webp)

And that's it! You've successfully set up your Coinbase Wallet app, connected it to the Moonbeam network, and learned how to send and receive funds.

## Subscribe to Updates from Moonbeam {: #subscribe-to-updates-from-moonbeam }

Coinbase Wallet has a messaging and subscription feature that uses [XMTP](https://docs.xmtp.org/){target=\_blank}, an on-chain messaging network designed to deliver fully encrypted messages between wallet addresses. In addition to messaging other Coinbase Wallet users who have enabled this feature, you can subscribe to updates from the Moonbeam Foundation. These updates are designed to provide timely and essential information from the Moonbeam Foundation, such as governance and protocol upgrade notifications. 

### Setting up Coinbase Wallet on Mobile {: #setting-up-coinbase-wallet-on-mobile }

To enable XMTP in your Coinbase Wallet App and subscribe to Moonbeam, you must have both the browser extension and the wallet dApp. The [Coinbase Wallet download page](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/downloads){target=\_blank} has links to both. After installation, ensure you have the same seed in both (e.g., don't create separate seed phrases for each). To get started with XMTP, from the first tab of the Coinbase Wallet App (the Assets tab), take the following steps:

1. Click the messaging icon in the upper right corner
2. Press **Start Messaging**

![Sign up for XMTP.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-8.webp)

Next, you'll be prompted to configure your notification settings to allow push notifications. Take the following steps:

1. Press **Enable Push Notifications**
2. Press **Allow** in the resulting prompt

![Configure notifications.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-9.webp)

### Subscribing in the Moonbeam dApp {: #subscribing-in-the-moonbeam-dapp }

As a quick reminder, you'll need to have the Coinbase Wallet extension installed on your computer's browser loaded with the same seed as the one used on your phone. To minimize the risk of errors, ensure that the Coinbase Wallet extension is the only cryptocurrency wallet extension active in your browser. You can temporarily disable other wallet apps as follows:

1. Click the Extensions Icon in the upper right corner
2. Click **Manage Extensions**
3. Disable any other active wallet extensions 

!!! note
    Disabling MetaMask keeps your keys intact, but removing MetaMask could result in losing your private keys. Be careful not to accidentally remove a wallet entirely.

![Disable other active crypto extensions.](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-10.webp)

Then, head to the [Moonbeam dApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam){target=\_blank}, and take the following steps to connect the Coinbase Wallet extension:

1. Press **Connect wallet** 
2. Select **Coinbase Wallet** from the list of options
3. Press **Connect** when Coinbase Wallet pops up

![Connect the Moonbeam dApp to Coinbase Wallet](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-11.webp)

To subscribe, take the following steps:

1. Press the Mailbox icon in the upper right
2. Press **Subscribe** in the pop-up

![Subscribe in the Moonbeam dApp](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-12.webp)

1. Press **Connect your wallet** in the resulting Coinbase pop up
2. Next, you'll have two signature requests in your Coinbase Wallet. The first one asks you to enable XTMP Identity. Press **Sign**
3. The next signature request is to enable the subscription to messages from the Moonbeam Foundation. Press **Sign**

!!! note
    You may receive three signature requests in the prior step if you didn't enable XMTP on your phone. The third signature request will take care of that, however, you may still need to enable notifications for the Coinbase Wallet app on your phone to ensure you receive them. 

![Confirm subscription](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-13.webp)

And that's it! Once done, you'll see the below confirmation screen. For questions about Coinbase Wallet, please refer to the [Coinbase Wallet Help](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/messaging/info#connecting-to-the-xmtp-network){target=\_blank}.

![Finalized](/images/tokens/connect/coinbase-wallet/coinbase-14.webp)

## Limitations {: #limitations }

 - At this time, Coinbase Wallet displays only outgoing transactions in your transaction history in the app. You can see your full transaction history, including incoming transactions, by looking up your address on a blockchain explorer such as [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - On the Coinbase Wallet mobile app, you can add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network; however, you won't be able to see your balances or send transactions from the app. You'll need to use the browser extension instead

# Interacting with Moonbeam Using Ledger and the Ethereum App

## Introduction {: #introduction } 

Hardware wallets provide a safer way to store crypto funds because the private key (used for signing transactions) is stored offline. Ledger offers two hardware wallet solutions at the time of writing: Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X.

For Moonbeam, Moonriver, and the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, you can use the Ethereum app on Ledger Live by setting the chain ID. For Moonbeam, the chain ID is 1284, for Moonriver it's 1285, and for Moonbase Alpha it's 1287.

For Moonbeam and Moonriver you also have the option of using the dedicated [Moonbeam app](/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/){target=\_blank} or [Moonriver app](/tokens/connect/ledger/moonriver/){target=\_blank} on Ledger Live, this way you do not have to worry about setting the chain ID and you know you are connected to the right network. Please note that you can only use the Moonbeam app to connect to the Moonbeam network, and the Moonriver app can only be used to connect to the Moonriver network. These dedicated apps will not work for other Moonbeam-based networks.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started with your Ledger hardware wallet on Moonbeam using the Ethereum app. This guide only illustrates the steps for a Ledger Nano X device, but you can follow along with a Ledger Nano S as well. 

<div class="intro-disclaimer">

</div>

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites } 

Before you get started, update [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live){target=\_blank} to the latest version available. Also, make sure you've your Ledger hardware wallet device running the latest firmware. The Ledger support website offers tutorials on [how to update](https://support.ledger.com/article/360013349800-zde){target=\_blank} the firmware.

At the time of writing, the following versions were used:

 - [Ledger Live 2.35.1](https://support.ledger.com/article/What-s-new-in-Ledger-Live){target=\_blank}
 - [Ledger Nano S firmware v2.0.0](https://support.ledger.com/article/360010446000-zd){target=\_blank}
 - [Ledger Nano X firmware v2.0.1](https://support.ledger.com/article/360014980580-zd){target=\_blank}

As of November 29, 2022, the Moonbeam and Ledger Live integration was released, allowing you to send and receive GLMR tokens with your Ledger device directly in Ledger Live. With this integration, you'll no longer need to connect your Ledger to MetaMask. If you prefer this method, please skip ahead to the [Use Ledger Live to Send & Receive GLMR](#use-ledger-live) section of this guide.

If you prefer to use MetaMask as an intermediary between your Ledger device and Moonbeam, make sure that your MetaMask is [connected to Moonbeam](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

As of [MetaMask version 10.5.0](https://consensys.io/blog/metamask-and-ledger-integration-fixed){target=\_blank}, connecting your Ledger device with MetaMask on Chrome is easy again. You just need to have the latest version of MetaMask installed.

## Install the Ledger Live App {: install-the-ledger-live-app }

If you want to connect to Moonbeam, Moonriver, or the Moonbase Alpha TestNet you can do so by installing the Ethereum app, and later on you'll need to specify a chain ID.

To get started, open up Ledger Live and:

1. Select **Manager** from the menu
2. Connect and unlock your device (this must be done before installation)
3. In the **App catalog** search for Ethereum (ETH) and click **Install**. Your Ledger device will show **Processing** and once the installation is complete, the app will appear on your Ledger device

In the Ledger Live app, depending on which app(s) you installed you should see them listed under the **Apps installed** tab on the **Manager** page. After the app(s) have been successfully installed, you can close out of Ledger Live. 

<img src="/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-1.webp" alt="Moonriver Ledger App Installed" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />

## Import your Ledger Account to MetaMask {: #import-your-ledger-account-to-metamask } 

Now that you've installed the app(s) on Ledger Live, you can connect your Ledger to the computer and unlock it, and open the Ethereum app. 

Then import your Ledger account to MetaMask using the following steps:

 1. Click on the top-right logo to expand the menu
 2. Select **Connect Hardware Wallet**

![MetaMask Connect Hardware Wallet](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-2.webp)

In the next screen, you are prompted to select which hardware wallet you'll like to use in MetaMask. At the moment of writing, only Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets are supported. Here, take the following steps:

 1. Select the Ledger logo
 2. Click on **Continue**

![MetaMask Select Ledger Hardware Wallet](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-3.webp)

If you're using Chrome or a Chrome-based browser like Brave, you'll be prompted to select your Ledger device to connect via WebHID:

1. Select your Ledger device from the pop-up
2. Click **Connect**

![Ledger on Chrome](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-4.webp)

If a pop-up doesn't appear, you may need to change your MetaMask settings to enable a WebHID connection. You can check and update your MetaMask settings by following these steps:

1. Expand the top-right menu and go to **Settings** 
2. Navigate to **Advanced**
3. Scroll down to **Preferred Ledger Connection Type** and select **WebHID** from the dropdown

!!! note
    The **Preferred Ledger Connection Type** setting is only available on Chrome and Chrome-based browsers. This setting doesn't exist on other browsers such as Firefox.

If MetaMask was able to connect successfully to your Ledger device, you should see a list of five Moonbeam/Ethereum-styled accounts. If not, double-check that Ledger Live is closed, you've connected your Ledger device to the computer, and unlocked it, and make sure the Ethereum app is open.

### Import Accounts and View Balances {: #import-accounts-and-view-balances } 

From the list of accounts, take the following steps:

 1. Select the accounts you would like to import from your Ledger device
 2. Click on **Unlock**

![MetaMask Select Ethereum Accounts to Import](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-5.webp)

If you've imported your Ledger account successfully, you should see your account and balance displayed in the main MetaMask screen like shown in the following image:

![MetaMask Successfully Imported Ledger Account](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-6.webp)

You can switch accounts in MetaMask at any time to view the balance of your other imported Ledger accounts.

You've now successfully imported a Moonbeam compatible account from your Ledger device and are now ready to start interacting with your Ledger device.

## Receive Tokens {: #receive-tokens } 

To get started interacting with your Ledger device, you will need to send some funds to it. Copy your address from MetaMask by clicking on your account name and address in MetaMask.


![MetaMask Copy Account](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-7.webp)

Next, you will need to obtain some GLMR, MOVR, or DEV tokens and using the address you just copied, send the tokens to your account. After the transaction has successfully gone through, you will see your balance update.

You can get DEV tokens for testing on Moonbase Alpha once every 24 hours from the [Moonbase Alpha Faucet](https://faucet.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}.

## Send Tokens {: #send-tokens } 

Next up is sending and signing transactions on Moonbeam using your Ledger device. To get started sending a transaction, click on the **Send** button:

![MetaMask Ledger Account Funded](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-8.webp)

As you would in a standard transaction, set the recipient address, enter the number of tokens to send, review transaction details and confirm it. This will initiate the transaction signature wizard in your Ledger device. Here, take the following steps:

 1. Click the button to proceed to the next screen. Your Ledger device is only warning you to review the transaction
 2. Check the number of tokens being sent then proceed to the next screen
 3. Check the recipient's address and proceed to the next screen
4. Check the chain ID of the network. This information confirms which network MetaMask is connected to. For Moonbeam the chain ID is 1284 (hex: 0x504), Moonriver is 1285 (hex: 0x505), and Moonbase Alpha is 1287 (hex: 0x507). When ready, proceed to the next screen
5. Check the max fees applicable to this transaction. This is the gas price multiplied by the gas limit you've set on MetaMask. When ready, proceed to the next screen
6. If you agree with all the transaction details, approve it. This will sign the transaction and will trigger MetaMask to send it. If you don't agree with all the transaction details, reject it. This will cancel the transaction, and MetaMask will mark it as failed

![MetaMask Ledger Transaction Wizard](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-9.webp)

Right after you've approved the transaction, MetaMask sends it to the network. Once the transaction is confirmed, it will be displayed as **Send** on the **Activity** tab in MetaMask.

![MetaMask Ledger Transaction Wizard](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-10.webp)

And that is it! You've signed a transaction and sent some tokens on Moonbeam using your Ledger hardware wallet!

## Interact with Contracts Using your Ledger {: #interact-with-contracts-using-your-ledger } 

By default, Ledger devices don't admit a `data` field in the transaction object. Consequently, users can't deploy or interact with smart contracts.

However, if you want to use your Ledger hardware wallet for transactions related to smart contracts, you need to change a configuration parameter inside the app on your device. To do so, take the following steps:

 1. On your Ledger, open the Moonriver or Ethereum app
 2. Navigate to **Settings**
 3. Find the **Blind signing** page. It should state **NOT Enabled** at the bottom
 4. Select/validate the option to change its value to **Enabled**

!!! note
    This option is necessary to use your Ledger device to interact with ERC-20 token contracts that might live inside the Moonbeam ecosystem.

![MetaMask Ledger Allow Contracts Tx](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-11.webp)

## Use Ledger Live to Send & Receive GLMR {: #use-ledger-live }

You can also use your Ledger device to send and receive GLMR tokens securely from within Ledger Live. This enables you to manage your GLMR tokens without connecting your device to MetaMask.

When you open up the Ledger Live app, make sure that you've installed the latest updates. If there are any pending updates that need to be installed, there will be a banner at the top of the screen that prompts you to install the updates.

## Introduction {: #introduction } 

Hardware wallets provide a safer way to store crypto funds because the private key (used for signing transactions) is stored offline. Ledger offers two hardware wallet solutions at the time of writing: Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X.

You can interact with Moonbeam using your Ledger hardware wallet through the Moonbeam Ledger Live app. With the dedicated Moonbeam app, you do not have to worry about setting the chain ID and you know you are connected to the right network. Please note that you can only use the Moonbeam app to connect to the Moonbeam network, it cannot be used to connect to other Moonbeam-based networks.

You also have the option of using the Ethereum app to connect to Moonbeam. The main difference between using the Moonbeam and the Ethereum app is that you have to specify the chain ID when you use the Ethereum app, which is 1284 for Moonbeam. If you're interested in using the Ethereum app instead, you can check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam Using Ledger and the Ethereum App](/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/){target=\_blank} guide.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started with your Ledger hardware wallet on Moonbeam using the Moonbeam app. This guide only illustrates the steps for a Ledger Nano X device, but you can follow along with a Ledger Nano S as well.

</div>

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites } 

Before you get started, update [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live){target=\_blank} to the latest version available. Also, make sure you've your Ledger hardware wallet device running the latest firmware. The Ledger support website offers tutorials on [how to update](https://support.ledger.com/article/360013349800-zde){target=\_blank} the firmware.

At the time of writing, the following versions were used:

 - [Ledger Live 2.35.1](https://support.ledger.com/article/What-s-new-in-Ledger-Live){target=\_blank}
 - [Ledger Nano S firmware v2.0.0](https://support.ledger.com/article/360010446000-zd){target=\_blank}
 - [Ledger Nano X firmware v2.0.1](https://support.ledger.com/article/360014980580-zd){target=\_blank}

As of November 29, 2022, the Moonbeam and Ledger Live integration was released, allowing you to send and receive GLMR tokens with your Ledger device directly in Ledger Live. With this integration, you'll no longer need to connect your Ledger to MetaMask. If you prefer this method, please skip ahead to the [Use Ledger Live to Send & Receive GLMR](#use-ledger-live) section of this guide.

If you prefer to use MetaMask as an intermediary between your Ledger device and Moonbeam, make sure that your MetaMask is [connected to Moonbeam](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

As of [MetaMask version 10.5.0](https://consensys.io/blog/metamask-and-ledger-integration-fixed){target=\_blank}, connecting your Ledger device with MetaMask on Chrome is easy again. You just need to have the latest version of MetaMask installed.

## Install the Moonbeam Ledger Live App {: install-the-moonbeam-ledger-live-app }

The Moonbeam app is dependent on the Ethereum app, so first you will need to install the Ethereum app. Once the Ethereum app is installed you will be able to install the Moonbeam app without a problem. Please note that the Moonbeam app is only for the Moonbeam network, it will not work for Moonriver or Moonbase Alpha.

To get started, open up Ledger Live and:

1. Select **Manager** from the menu
2. Connect and unlock your device (this must be done before installation)
3. In the **App catalog** search for Ethereum (ETH) and click **Install**. Your Ledger device will show **Processing** and once the installation is complete, the app will appear on your Ledger device
4. Search for Moonbeam (GLMR) in the **App catalog** and click **Install**. Again, your Ledger device will show **Processing** and once complete, the Moonbeam app will appear on your Ledger device

In the Ledger Live app, you should see the Ethereum and Moonbeam app listed under the **Apps installed** tab on the **Manager** page. After the apps have been successfully installed, you can close out of Ledger Live. 

<img src="/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-1.webp" alt="Moonriver Ledger App Installed" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />

## Import your Ledger Account to MetaMask {: #import-your-ledger-account-to-metamask }

Then import your Ledger account to MetaMask using the following steps:

 1. Click on the top-right logo to expand the menu
 2. Select **Connect Hardware Wallet**

![MetaMask Connect Hardware Wallet](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-2.webp)

In the next screen, you are prompted to select which hardware wallet you'll like to use in MetaMask. At the moment of writing, only Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets are supported. Here, take the following steps:

 1. Select the Ledger logo
 2. Click on **Continue**

![MetaMask Select Ledger Hardware Wallet](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-3.webp)

If you're using Chrome or a Chrome-based browser like Brave, you'll be prompted to select your Ledger device to connect via WebHID:

1. Select your Ledger device from the pop-up
2. Click **Connect**

![Ledger on Chrome](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-4.webp)

If a pop-up doesn't appear, you may need to change your MetaMask settings to enable a WebHID connection. You can check and update your MetaMask settings by following these steps:

1. Expand the top-right menu and go to **Settings** 
2. Navigate to **Advanced**
3. Scroll down to **Preferred Ledger Connection Type** and select **WebHID** from the dropdown

!!! note
    The **Preferred Ledger Connection Type** setting is only available on Chrome and Chrome-based browsers. This setting doesn't exist on other browsers such as Firefox.

If MetaMask was able to connect successfully to your Ledger device, you should see a list of five Moonbeam/Ethereum-styled accounts. If not, double-check that Ledger Live is closed, you've connected your Ledger device to the computer, unlocked it, and have the Moonbeam app open.

### Import Accounts and View Balances {: #import-accounts-and-view-balances } 

From the list of accounts, take the following steps:

 1. Select the accounts you would like to import from your Ledger device
 2. Click on **Unlock**

![MetaMask Select Ethereum Accounts to Import](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-5.webp)

If you've imported your Ledger account successfully, you should see your account and balance displayed in the main MetaMask screen like shown in the following image:

![MetaMask Successfully Imported Ledger Account](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-6.webp)

You can switch accounts in MetaMask at any time to view the balance of your other imported Ledger accounts.

You've now successfully imported a Moonbeam compatible account from your Ledger device and are now ready to start interacting with your Ledger device.

## Receive Tokens {: #receive-tokens } 

To get started interacting with your Ledger device, you will need to send some funds to it. Copy your address from MetaMask by clicking on your account name and address in MetaMask.

![MetaMask Copy Account](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-7.webp)

Next, you will need to obtain some GLMR tokens and using the address you just copied, send the tokens to your account. After the transaction has successfully gone through, you will see your balance update.

## Send Tokens {: #send-tokens } 

Next up is sending and signing transactions on Moonbeam using your Ledger device. To get started sending a transaction, click on the **Send** button:

![MetaMask Ledger Account Funded](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-8.webp)

As you would in a standard transaction, set the recipient address, enter the number of tokens to send, review transaction details and confirm it. This will initiate the transaction signature wizard in your Ledger device. Here, take the following steps:

 1. Click the button to proceed to the next screen. Your Ledger device is only warning you to review the transaction
 2. Check the number of tokens being sent then proceed to the next screen
 3. Check the recipient's address and proceed to the next screen
4. Check the max fees applicable to this transaction. This is the gas price multiplied by the gas limit you've set on MetaMask. When ready, proceed to the next screen
 5. If you agree with all the transaction details, approve it. This will sign the transaction and will trigger MetaMask to send it. If you don't agree with all the transaction details, reject it. This will cancel the transaction, and MetaMask will mark it as failed

![MetaMask Ledger Transaction Wizard](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-9.webp)

Right after you've approved the transaction, MetaMask sends it to the network. Once the transaction is confirmed, it will be displayed as **Send** on the **Activity** tab in MetaMask.

![MetaMask Ledger Transaction Wizard](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonbeam/ledger-10.webp)

And that is it! You've signed a transaction and sent some GLMR tokens using your Ledger hardware wallet!

## Interact with Contracts Using your Ledger {: #interact-with-contracts-using-your-ledger } 

By default, Ledger devices don't admit a `data` field in the transaction object. Consequently, users can't deploy or interact with smart contracts.

However, if you want to use your Ledger hardware wallet for transactions related to smart contracts, you need to change a configuration parameter inside the app on your device. To do so, take the following steps:

 1. On your Ledger, open the Moonriver or Ethereum app
 2. Navigate to **Settings**
 3. Find the **Blind signing** page. It should state **NOT Enabled** at the bottom
 4. Select/validate the option to change its value to **Enabled**

!!! note
    This option is necessary to use your Ledger device to interact with ERC-20 token contracts that might live inside the Moonbeam ecosystem.

You've now successfully imported a Moonriver compatible account from your Ledger device and are now ready to start interacting with your Ledger device.

## Receive Tokens {: #receive-tokens } 

To get started interacting with your Ledger device, you will need to send some funds to it. Copy your address from MetaMask by clicking on your account name and address in MetaMask.

![MetaMask Copy Account](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonriver/ledger-7.webp)

Next, you will need to obtain some MOVR tokens and using the address you just copied, send the tokens to your account. After the transaction has successfully gone through, you will see your balance update.

## Send Tokens {: #send-tokens }

Next up is sending and signing transactions on Moonriver using your Ledger device. To get started sending a transaction, click on the **Send** button:

![MetaMask Ledger Account Funded](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonriver/ledger-8.webp)

As you would in a standard transaction, set the recipient address, enter the number of tokens to send, review transaction details and confirm it. This will initiate the transaction signature wizard in your Ledger device. Here, take the following steps:

 1. Click the button to proceed to the next screen. Your Ledger device is only warning you to review the transaction
 2. Check the number of tokens being sent then proceed to the next screen
 3. Check the recipient's address and proceed to the next screen
4. Check the max fees applicable to this transaction. This is the gas price multiplied by the gas limit you've set on MetaMask. When ready, proceed to the next screen
 5. If you agree with all the transaction details, approve it. This will sign the transaction and will trigger MetaMask to send it. If you don't agree with all the transaction details, reject it. This will cancel the transaction, and MetaMask will mark it as failed

![MetaMask Ledger Transaction Wizard](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonriver/ledger-9.webp)

Right after you've approved the transaction, MetaMask sends it to the network. Once the transaction is confirmed, it will be displayed as **Send** on the **Activity** tab in MetaMask.

![MetaMask Ledger Transaction Wizard](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonriver/ledger-10.webp)

And that is it! You've signed a transaction and sent some MOVR tokens using your Ledger hardware wallet!

## Interact with Contracts Using your Ledger {: #interact-with-contracts-using-your-ledger } 

By default, Ledger devices don't admit a `data` field in the transaction object. Consequently, users can't deploy or interact with smart contracts.

However, if you want to use your Ledger hardware wallet for transactions related to smart contracts, you need to change a configuration parameter inside the app on your device. To do so, take the following steps:

 1. On your Ledger, open the Moonriver or Ethereum app
 2. Navigate to **Settings**
 3. Find the **Blind signing** page. It should state **NOT Enabled** at the bottom
 4. Select/validate the option to change its value to **Enabled**

!!! note
    This option is necessary to use your Ledger device to interact with ERC-20 token contracts that might live inside the Moonbeam ecosystem.

# Interacting with Moonbeam Using MathWallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

MathWallet [announced](https://mathwallet.org/moonbeam-wallet/en) that it is now natively supporting each of the [Moonbeam-based networks](/learn/platform/networks/){target=\_blank}. This means that you are now able to interact with any of the networks using another wallet besides MetaMask.

In this tutorial, we'll go through how to setup MathWallet to connect to each of the networks: [Moonbeam](#connect-to-moonbeam), [Moonriver](#connect-to-moonriver), and [Moonbase Alpha](#connect-to-moonbase-alpha). We'll also present a brief example of using MathWallet as a Web3 provider for other tools such as [Remix](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank}.

<div class="intro-disclaimer">
  The information presented herein is for informational purposes only and has been provided by third parties. Moonbeam does not endorse any project listed and described on the Moonbeam docs website (https://docs.moonbeam.network/).

Now that you've successfully connected to Moonriver, you can skip ahead to the [Adding a Wallet](#adding-a-wallet) section to get started creating or importing a wallet.

## Connect to Moonbase Alpha {: #connect-to-moonbase-alpha }

In this part, we'll go through the process of connecting MathWallet to Moonbase Alpha. First you'll need to enable Moonbase Alpha. To do so, go to the settings by clicking on the gear icon. Then click on **Networks** and scroll down through the **Ethereum** section until you find **Moonbase Alpha** and toggle the switch.

![Enable Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-6.webp)

Lastly you'll need to switch to Moonbase Alpha. From the main screen, click **Switch Network** and select **Moonbase Alpha**.

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-7.webp)

And that is it, you now have MathWallet connected to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet! Your wallet should look like this:

![Wallet Connected to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-8.webp)

Now that you've successfully connected to Moonbase Alpha, you can move on to the [Adding a Wallet](#adding-a-wallet) section to get started creating or importing a wallet.

## Adding a Wallet {: #adding-a-wallet }

The following steps will show you how to interact with the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, but can also be used to interact with Moonbeam and Moonriver.

After you are connected to Moonbase Alpha, you can now create a wallet to get an account and start interacting with the TestNet. Currently, there are three ways to add a wallet:

 - Create a wallet
 - Import an existing wallet using a mnemonic or private key
 - Connect hardware wallet (_not supported for now_)

### Create a Wallet {: #create-a-wallet }

The following steps for creating a wallet can be modified for Moonbeam and Moonriver.

To create a new wallet, click the :heavy_plus_sign: sign next to **Moonbase Alpha** and select **Create Wallet**.

![MathWallet create a wallet](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-9.webp)

Set and confirm a wallet name. Next, make sure you safely store the mnemonic, as it provides direct access to your funds. Once you have completed the process, you should see your newly created wallet with its associated public address.

![MathWallet wallet created](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-10.webp)

### Import a Wallet {: #import-a-wallet }

To create a new wallet, click the :heavy_plus_sign: sign next to **Moonbase Alpha** and select **Import Wallet**.

![MathWallet import a wallet](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-11.webp)

Next, select between importing using a mnemonic or a private key. For the first option, enter the mnemonic word by word, separated by spaces. For the second option, enter the private key (either with the `0x` prefix or not, it works both ways).

![MathWallet private key or mnemonic import](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-12.webp)

After clicking next, set a wallet name, and that is it! You should see your imported wallet with its associated public address.

![MathWallet imported wallet](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-13.webp)

## Using MathWallet {: #using-mathwallet }

MathWallet serves as a Web3 provider in tools such as [Remix](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/). By having MathWallet connected to Moonbase Alpha or Moonriver, you can deploy contracts as you would like using MetaMask, signing the transactions with MathWallet instead.

For example, in Remix, when deploying a smart contract to Moonbase Alpha, make sure you select the **Injected Web3** option in the **ENVIRONMENT** menu. If you have MathWallet connected, you will see the TestNet chain ID just below the box (_{{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }}_) and your MathWallet account injected into Remix as well. When sending a transaction, you should see a similar pop-up from MathWallet:

![MathWallet sign transaction](/images/tokens/connect/mathwallet/mathwallet-14.webp)

By clicking on **Accept** you are signing this transaction, and the contract will be deployed to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet.

# Interacting with Moonbeam Using MetaMask

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers can leverage Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility features to integrate tools, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, into their dApps. By doing so, they can use the injected library MetaMask provides to interact with the blockchain.

Currently, MetaMask can be configured to connect to a few networks: Moonbeam, Moonriver, the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, and a Moonbeam development node.

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to the network of your choice:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbeam">Connect to Moonbeam</a>
</div>

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonriver">Connect to Moonriver</a>
</div>

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbase">Connect to Moonbase Alpha</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will pop up asking for permission to add a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network.

Learn [how to integrate a Connect MetaMask button](/builders/integrations/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank} into your dApp, so that users can connect to Moonbase Alpha with a simple click of a button. The guide can also be adapted for the other Moonbeam-based networks.

<div class="intro-disclaimer">
  The information presented herein is for informational purposes only and has been provided by third parties. Moonbeam does not endorse any project listed and described on the Moonbeam docs website (https://docs.moonbeam.network/).
</div>

## Install the MetaMask Extension {: #install-the-metamask-extension }

First, you'll start with a fresh and default [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank} installation from the Chrome store. After downloading, installing, and initializing the extension, follow the **Get Started** guide. In there, you need to create a wallet, set a password, and store your secret backup phrase (this gives direct access to your funds, so make sure to store these in a secure place).

## Setup a Wallet {: #setup-a-wallet }

After installing [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, the setup will automatically open a new task with a welcome screen. Here, you are offered two options:

- **Create a new wallet** - you'll go through some steps to get a new seed phrase. Ensure you store this phrase securely and you don't share it publicly
- **Import an existing wallet** - you already have a seed phrase stored, and you want to restore an account from that recovery phrase

![Metamask Setup Interface](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-1.webp)

Once you've selected the option that fits your needs, follow the steps, and you should be all set.

!!! note
    Multiple accounts can be derived from a seed phrase by changing what is known as the address index. By default, when creating or importing an account from the seed phrase, you get the account with the address index 0. You can get the other indexes by just adding new accounts in the main Metamask screen.

## Import Accounts {: #import-accounts }

Once you've created a wallet or imported an existing one, you can also import any account into MetaMask if you hold the private keys.

For this example, you'll use private keys from the development account. Click the account switcher button to import an account using its private keys. That is where it says **Account 1**.

![Importing account from private key metamask menu](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-2.webp)

Next, click on **Import Account**.

![Importing account from private key account switcher menu](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-3.webp)

Finally, enter the private keys of the account you are trying to import. For example, you can use one of the accounts prefunded in the Moonbeam development node. This guide uses Gerald's key. Once you've entered the private key, click on **Import**.

## Interact with the Network {: #interact-with-the-network }

Once you've [connected Metamask](#connect-metamask-to-moonbeam) to any Moonbeam-based network, you can start using your wallet by:

- Sending a token transfer to another address
- Adding ERC-20s to Metamask and interacting with them
- Adding ERC-721s to Metamask and interacting with them

### Initiate a Transfer { #initiate-a-transfer }

This section showcases how to do a simple token transfer to another address as an example of using Metamask with Moonbeam.

To do so, take the following steps:

1. Ensure you are connected to the correct network
2. Ensure you have selected the account you want to use for the transfer
3. On the main screen of your Metamask wallet, click on **Send**

![Initiate balance transfer in Metamask](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-10.webp)

Next, you can enter the address to which you want to send the tokens. For this example, a wallet that has already been imported to Metamask is selected, known as **Bob**.

![Select account to send tokens to in Metamask](/images/tokens/connect/metamask/metamask-11.webp)

On the next screen, take the following steps:

1. Enter the number of tokens you want to send
2. Verify that all the information is correct, and click on **Next**

# Fiat On-Ramp Services to Acquire GLMR for Moonbeam

## Introduction

Interacting with dApps or deploying smart contracts on Moonbeam requires users to hold GLMR tokens, which are used to pay for network transaction fees (gas), except when using [gasless transactions](/tutorials/eth-api/call-permit-gasless-txs/){target=\_blank}. To help users acquire GLMR, there are several reliable on-ramp services available to convert local currency (fiat) into GLMR. This guide covers two popular options - [Transak](https://transak.com/buy/glmr){target=\_blank} and [Onramp](https://onramp.money/){target=\_blank} - each offering different payment methods and features to suit individual needs. Supporting bank transfers, credit cards, and mobile payment solutions, these platforms provide secure and regulated ways to acquire GLMR tokens. 

You can find a current list of supported on-ramps on the [Moonbeam dApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam){target=\_blank}. Please be aware that the availability of these services may vary by jurisdiction. For more information, please visit the website of the respective on-ramp. 

## Transak

Using Transak is a straightforward way to purchase GLMR tokens for the Moonbeam network. The process begins at [Transak](https://transak.com/buy/glmr){target=\_blank} with selecting GLMR as the desired cryptocurrency. Users select their local currency and purchase amount, then review the associated fees and processing time details. The next step requires entering the destination Moonbeam wallet address. For bank transfers and other fiat payment methods, a one-time KYC verification process must be completed by providing valid identification documents. After payment completion through the selected method (bank transfer, credit card, or other supported options), Transak processes the transaction and sends the GLMR tokens directly to the specified wallet address. Delivery time varies depending on the payment method selected, ranging from near-instant for card payments to up to 2 business days for bank transfers.

## Onramp

[Onramp](https://onramp.money/){target=\_blank} offers a seamless fiat-to-crypto gateway for purchasing GLMR tokens, supporting over 400 different cryptocurrencies through their platform. The process begins with a straightforward phone-based OTP login system for verification. After login, the platform displays transaction details, including the GLMR amount and current market rates, for confirmation. Based on geographical location, Onramp displays relevant bank account details and available payment methods. Once payment is completed through the selected method, Onramp handles all aspects of the conversion - from payment processing to regulatory compliance and wallet management. Upon confirmation of the deposit, the platform automatically purchases GLMR at the current market price and then initiates an automatic withdrawal to the specified Moonbeam wallet address. Additional KYC verification may be required for larger transactions, but the platform manages all compliance requirements internally to ensure a smooth experience.

# How to use Polkadot.js Apps to Interact with Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

As a Polkadot parachain, Moonbeam uses a [unified account structure](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} that allows you to interact with Substrate (Polkadot) functionality and Moonbeam's EVM, all from a single Ethereum-style address. This unified account structure means that you don't need to maintain both a Substrate and an Ethereum account to interact with Moonbeam - instead, you can do it all with a single Ethereum private key.

The Polkadot.js Apps interface natively supports H160 addresses and ECDSA keys. So, in this tutorial, you can check out this integration of Ethereum-based accounts on [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts){target=\_blank}.

<div class="intro-disclaimer">
  The information presented herein is for informational purposes only and has been provided by third parties. Moonbeam does not endorse any project listed and described on the Moonbeam docs website (https://docs.moonbeam.network/).
</div>

!!! note
    Polkadot.js Apps is phasing out support for accounts stored locally in the browser's cache. Instead, it is recommended that you use a browser extension like [Talisman to inject your accounts into Polkadot.js Apps](/tokens/connect/talisman/){target=\_blank}.

## Connect Polkadot.js Apps to Moonbeam {: #connect-polkadotjs-apps }

When launching [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts){target=\_blank} for the first time, you may or may not be connected to the desired network.

You can change the selected network by clicking the logo in the top left corner, where you'll find a list of networks organized by MainNets, TestNets, and local networks. Each network can be found under the following sections:

|          Network          |        Section        |
|:-------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|          Moonbeam         | Polkadot & Parachains |
|         Moonriver         |  Kusama & Parachains  |
|       Moonbase Alpha      |     Test Networks     |
| Moonbeam Development Node |      Development      |

Once you've selected the correct network, you can scroll back to the top and click **Switch**.

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-1.webp)

After switching, the Polkadot.js site will not only connect to the chosen network, but the logo and styling will change for each network.

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-2.webp)

## Create or Import an H160 Account into Polkadot.js Apps {: #creating-or-importing-an-h160-account }

!!! note
    For security purposes, it is recommended that you do not store accounts locally in the browser. A more secure method is using a browser extension like [Talisman to inject your accounts into Polkadot.js Apps](/tokens/connect/talisman/){target=\_blank}.

In this section, you'll learn how you can create a new account or import a preexisting MetaMask account to Polkadot.js Apps. First, there is one prerequisite step. As part of the process of phasing out support for accounts stored locally in the browser's cache, you'll need to enable support for local storage of accounts in the **Settings** tab. To do so, take the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab
2. Select **Allow local in-browser account storage** under the **in-browser account creation** heading
3. Press **Save**

![Allow local in-browser account storage](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-3.webp)

You can now head back to the [Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts){target=\_blank} and proceed with the next steps:

1. Navigate to the **Accounts** section
2. Click on the **Add account** button

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-4.webp)

This will open a wizard pop-up that will guide you through the process of adding an account to the Polkadot.js Apps interface:

1. Click on the drop-down menu
2. Change the selection from **Mnemonic** to **Private Key**, this allows you to add an account through a private key

!!! note
    Currently, you can only create or import accounts in Polkadot.js via a private key. Doing so with the mnemonic will result in a different public address if you later try to import this account to an Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask. This is because Polkadot.js uses BIP39, whereas Ethereum uses BIP32 or BIP44.

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-5.webp)

Next, if you want to create a new account, make sure you store the private key displayed by the wizard. If you want to import an existing account, enter your private key that you can export from MetaMask.

!!! note
    Never reveal your private keys as they give direct access to your funds. The steps in this guide are for demonstration purposes only.

Make sure to include the prefix in the private key, i.e., `0x`. If you entered the information correctly, the corresponding public address should appear in the upper left corner of the window, and then click **Next**.

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-6.webp)

To finish the wizard, you can set an account name and password. After a confirmation message, you should see in the main **Accounts** tab the address with the corresponding balance: in this case, Bob's address. Moreover, you can overlay the MetaMask extension to see that both balances are the same.

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-7.webp)

## Send a Transaction Through Substrate's API {: #sending-a-transaction-through-substrates-api }

Now, to demonstrate the potential of Moonbeam's [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} scheme, you can make a transfer through the Substrate API using Polkadot.js Apps. Remember that you are interacting with Substrate using an Ethereum-style H160 address. To do so, you can import another account.

Next, click on Bob's **send** button, which opens another wizard that guides you through the process of sending a transaction.

1. Set the **send to address**
2. Enter the **amount** to send, which for this example is 1 DEV token
3. When ready, click on the **Make Transfer** button

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-8.webp)

Then you'll be prompted to enter your password and sign and submit the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see the balances updated for each account.

![Connect to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/polkadotjs-9.webp)

And that is it! We are excited about being able to support H160 accounts in Polkadot.js Apps, as we believe this will greatly enhance the user experience on the Moonbeam Network and its Ethereum compatibility features.

# Interacting with Moonbeam Using SubWallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers and users of Moonbeam have a variety of options when it comes to wallets. Thanks to Moonbeam's seamless Ethereum compatibility, Moonbeam supports a great variety of popular wallets, including [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app){target=\_blank}.

SubWallet is a comprehensive Web3 wallet that natively supports Substrate and Ethereum accounts. Although Moonbeam is a Substrate-based blockchain, it has a [unified account system](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} that replaces the default Substrate-style accounts and keys with Ethereum-style accounts and keys. Since SubWallet supports Ethereum-style accounts, you can interact with your Moonbeam account using SubWallet.

This guide takes you through all the necessary steps, from installing SubWallet to setting up a wallet, connecting it to Moonbeam, and sending funds.

<div class="intro-disclaimer">
  The information presented herein is for informational purposes only and has been provided by third parties. Moonbeam does not endorse any project listed and described on the Moonbeam docs website (https://docs.moonbeam.network/).
</div>

## Install SubWallet {: #install-subwallet }

There are several ways you can interact with SubWallet: they have **a browser extension, a mobile app, and a web-accessible dashboard**.

You can get started by heading to [SubWallet's download page](https://www.subwallet.app/download.html){target=\_blank} and downloading SubWallet for the platform of your choice.

If you choose to use the web-accessible dashboard, you won't need to download anything. You can access the dashboard at [web.subwallet.app](https://web.subwallet.app/welcome){target=\_blank}.

The interfaces for the mobile app, browser extension, and web dashboard are quite similar, so you can adapt the following instructions, which focus on the browser extension, for the mobile app and web dashboard.

## Setup a Wallet {: #setup-a-wallet }

Once you've downloaded the SubWallet Browser Extension, you'll be prompted to set up your wallet. You'll be able to choose from the following options:

- **Create a new account** - allows you to create an entirely new account by creating a password and generating a seed phrase
- **Import an account** - allows you to import an existing account using the seed phrase, JSON file, private key, or by QR code
- **Attach an account** - allows you to connect to an account without the private key. You can use this method to connect to a cold storage wallet, like Keystone, or a watch-only account. With a watch-only account, you will not be able to transfer funds or interact with your account; you'll only be able to view account balances

    !!! note
        Ledger is supported on the browser extension but is not yet available on the mobile app. Support for Ledger on the mobile app is coming soon!

- **Connect wallet** - *only available on the web dashboard* - allows you to connect to a browser extension wallet. You can use this method to easily connect to an account you've created using the SubWallet browser extension or another wallet, such as MetaMask

The following sections will provide step-by-step instructions for [creating a new account](#create-a-new-account) and [importing an existing account](#import-an-account) with SubWallet.

If you're attaching an account, you can find step-by-step instructions on [SubWallet's Account management documentation](https://docs.subwallet.app/main/extension-user-guide/account-management){target=\_blank}. Similarly, if you're connecting a wallet on the web dashboard, you can find instructions on [SubWallet's Connect extension documentation](https://docs.subwallet.app/main/web-dashboard-user-guide/account-management/connect-extension){target=\_blank}.

### Create a New Account {: #create-a-new-account }

Creating a new account will generate a seed phrase that can derive multiple Ethereum and Substrate accounts. By default, SubWallet will generate a single Ethereum and a single Substrate account, but you can easily derive more from the same seed phrase. To interact with Moonbeam, you will need to use an Ethereum account. Click **Create a new account** to get started.

![The main screen of the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-1.webp)

On the following screen, you'll be prompted to create a password to secure your new wallet:

1. Enter a password that has at least 8 characters
2. Confirm the password by entering it again
3. Click **Continue**

![The create a password screen on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-2.webp)

You'll then be prompted to back up your seed phrase. This is an important step, especially because you have the option to later derive additional accounts from this seed phrase.

1. View your seed phrase and save it in a safe place

    !!! remember
        You should never share your seed phrase (mnemonic) or private key with anyone. This gives them direct access to your funds. This guide is for educational purposes only.

2. Once you've safely stored your seed phrase, click **I have kept it somewhere safe**

![Back up your seed phrase on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-3.webp)

!!! note
    If you're creating a new account on the mobile app, you'll have to re-enter your seed phrase to verify that you have stored it. The words have to be entered in the correct order.

After you've created a password and saved your seed phrase, you'll be connected to your account. You can [add additional accounts](#add-additional-accounts) at any time.

### Import an Account {: #import-an-account }

To import an existing account into SubWallet, you can select **Import an account**.

![The main screen of the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-4.webp)

On the following screen, select the method by which you would like to import the existing account. You can choose from **Import from seed phrase**, **Import from Polkadot.{js}**, **Import by MetaMask private key**, and **Import by QR code**.

If you select **Import from seed phrase**, there are some incompatibility issues that can arise when importing an account from seed phrase. For example, Trust Wallet and SafePal are among the wallets not compatible with SubWallet. If you run into incompatibility issues, SubWallet recommends creating a new wallet.

If you select **Import from Polkadot.{js}**, you'll need to make sure that the account was created in Polkadot.js via private key. If it was created with a seed phrase and you attempt to import it to SubWallet, a different public address will be used. This is because Polkadot.js uses [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki){target=\_blank}, whereas Ethereum uses [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki){target=\_blank} or [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki){target=\_blank}.

![Select the import option from the Import account screen of the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-5.webp)

If you import your account via seed phrase, you can select your account type as either Substrate (Polkadot) or EVM (Ethereum), or both. Moonbeam uses Ethereum-style accounts, so you'll need to select **Ethereum** to import an account for Moonbeam-based networks.

![Select the account type to import on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-6.webp)

Once you've completed the import process, you'll be prompted to enter a password to secure your new wallet:

1. Enter a password that has at least 8 characters
2. Confirm the password by entering it again
3. Click **Continue**

![The create a password screen on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-7.webp)

Next, you'll be able to provide the relevant seed phrase, private key, JSON file, or QR code, and you can begin using your new account right away. You can add [additional accounts](#add-additional-accounts) at any time.

### Add Additional Accounts {: #add-additional-accounts }

After you have created a new account or imported an existing account to SubWallet, you can add additional accounts by taking the following steps:

1. Click on the account dropdown
2. Select one of the options from the bottom of the screen. You can click **Create a new account**, the import button to import an existing account, or the attach button to attach to an existing cold storage wallet or watch-only account

![View account details and create a new account, import one, or attach one.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-8.webp)

If you're creating a new account, you can then choose **Create with new seed phrase** or **Derive from an existing account**. If you're creating a new account with a new seed phrase, you'll need to select the account type and back up the account, similar to the instructions in the [Create a New Account](#create-a-new-account) section. If you choose to derive a new account, you'll be prompted to select the existing account that you want to derive the account from.

If you're importing a new account, you'll need to choose whether to import using a seed phrase, JSON file, MetaMask private key or QR code, then repeat the process outlined in the [Import an Account](#import-an-account) section.

If you're attaching an account, you can find out step-by-step instructions on [SubWallet's Account management documentation](https://docs.subwallet.app/main/extension-user-guide/account-management){target=\_blank}.

## Connect SubWallet to Moonbeam {: #connect-subwallet-to-moonbeam }

To configure SubWallet for Moonbeam, select the **Customize your asset display** icon next to the **Search a token** icon.

![The tokens screen on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-9.webp)

To add Moonbeam, you can:

1. Search for "Moon" to view all Moonbeam-based networks, or search for a specific network
2. Toggle the switch to connect to the network

![The customize asset display screen on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-10.webp)

If you're trying to connect to a [local Moonbeam development node](/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam-dev/){target=\_blank}, you can select the hamburger menu from the top left corner, which will take you to the settings page.

## Interact with the Network {: #interact-with-the-network }

Once you've [connected SubWallet](#connect-subwallet-to-moonbeam) to any Moonbeam-based network, you can start using your wallet by:

- Receiving a token from another address
- Sending a token to another address
- Adding tokens to SubWallet and interacting with them

### Receive a Token {: #receive-a-token }

To receive a token from another account, you would need to show your wallet address to your counterparty, and they can send their assets to such address.

To copy your address, click on the **Get address** icon.

![The tokens screen on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-15.webp)

If you have multiple accounts and have selected **All accounts** from the account dropdown menu, you'll need to select the receiving account you want to send the assets to. Otherwise, make sure that the account you're connected to (which is displayed at the top of the screen) is the account you want to send the assets to. **This should be your Moonbeam account, which is an Ethereum-style address.**

![Select an account to receive tokens on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-16.webp)

Next, you can search for and choose the token that you would like to receive. For this example, DEV is chosen.

![Search and choose desired token on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-17.webp)

!!! note
    SubWallet supports receiving cross-chain tokens, so please be sure to check that the chain logo under the token name matches your desired chain.

You will be shown the QR code and the address linked to your account. **Double-check that the address shown is an Ethereum-style account**.

![QR code and address to receive tokens on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-18.webp)

Now you just need to show the QR code or address to the sender.

### Send a Transaction {: #send-a-transaction }

To get started with a simple token transfer to another address on Moonbeam, you can click the **Send** icon.

![The tokens screen on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-19.webp)

Next, you can take the following steps:

1. Specify the asset to send and the destination chain

    !!! note
        Some tokens are allowed to be transferred cross-chain, so when choosing the destination network, you can choose the dropdown menu to see the available options.

2. Enter the destination address, which can also be done using the address book or by scanning the recipient's QR code

    !!! note
        If you're using the mobile app, click **Next** to proceed.

3. Enter the amount of tokens to send
4. Look over the transaction details, then press **Transfer**

![The transfer screen on the SubWallet browser extension, where you can enter in the transaction details.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-20.webp)

On the next screen, you'll be able to review the transaction details and submit the transaction. If the transaction details look good, you can click **Approve** to send the transaction.

![The transfer confirmation screen on the SubWallet browser extension.](/images/tokens/connect/subwallet/subwallet-21.webp)

After you send the transaction, you'll be able to review the transaction details.

# Interacting with Moonbeam Using Talisman

## Introduction {: #introduction }

As a Polkadot parachain, Moonbeam uses a [unified account structure](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} that allows you to interact with Substrate (Polkadot) functionality and Moonbeam's EVM, all from a single Ethereum-style address. This unified account structure means that you don't need to maintain both a Substrate and an Ethereum account to interact with Moonbeam - instead, you can do it all with a single Ethereum private key.

[Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts){target=\_blank} supports H160 accounts injected into the browser via an extension like [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz){target=\_blank}. Note, Polkadot.js Apps is phasing out support for [accounts stored locally in the browser's cache](/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/). While you can continue to use any accounts that you've imported and stored in your browser locally via Polkadot.js Apps, you won't be able to add any new ones. This means that you'll need to use an extension like Talisman. Furthermore, injecting your account from an extension like Talisman is generally regarded to be safer than storing the account directly in the browser.

This guide will include all of the steps for setting up an account in Talisman and using it to interact with Moonbeam through Polkadot.js Apps.

## Setting up Talisman {: #setting-up-talisman }

Talisman is a crypto-wallet that natively supports Substrate (Polkadot) and Ethereum accounts. The Talisman wallet browser extension is available on [Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/talisman-wallet/fijngjgcjhjmmpcmkeiomlglpeiijkld){target=\_blank} and [Brave](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/talisman-wallet/fijngjgcjhjmmpcmkeiomlglpeiijkld){target=\_blank}, and a corresponding asset dashboard is accessible at [app.talisman.xyz](https://app.talisman.xyz){target=\_blank}

First, download and install the [Talisman extension](https://talisman.xyz){target=\_blank}. Once the extension opens up, you'll be prompted to either create a new wallet or import an existing one. For the purposes of this demo, you'll create a new wallet. On the following screen you'll be prompted to create a password to secure the new wallet.  

![Create a new wallet or import an existing one into Talisman.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-1.webp)

!!! Remember
    Talisman does not require you to back up your seed phrase but will nudge you with a reminder at the bottom of the screen. If you don't back up your seed phrase, you could lose all of your assets.

To back up your newly created wallet, take the following steps:

1. Press **Backup Now**
2. Enter the password to your Talisman wallet
3. Press **View Recovery Phrase** and store it in a secure place

![Back up your Talisman recovery phrase.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-2.webp)

## Setting up Talisman to Connect to Testnets {: #setting-up-talisman-to-connect-to-testnets }

Talisman works with all Moonbeam networks [after you enable Ethereum accounts](#connecting-talisman-to-moonbase-alpha-polkadot.js-apps). You can also see your balances across all networks in the **Portfolio** tab by clicking on the extension's Talisman logo in the upper left-hand corner. By default, Talisman hides your testnet account balances. However, you can change this by taking the following steps:

1. Open the Talisman extension and click on the Talisman logo
2. Select **Settings**
3. Select **Ethereum Networks**
4. Click **Enable Testnets**

![See your Moonbase Alpha testnet account balances in Talisman.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-3.webp)

## Connecting Talisman to Moonbeam and Polkadot.js Apps {: #connecting-talisman-to-moonbase-alpha-polkadot.js-apps }

Connecting Talisman to a Moonbeam-based network in Polkadot.js Apps is straightforward. Remember that you need to [enable testnets](#setting-up-talisman-to-connect-to-testnets) if you want to connect to Moonbase Alpha.

To connect to a Moonbeam-based network, the Moonbase Alpha testnet in this example, head to [Moonbase Alpha Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts){target=\_blank}. The Talisman extension will prompt you to select the accounts you'd like to use with Polkadot.js Apps. If it doesn't automatically pop up, you can open the Talisman extension and press the **Connected / Not Connected** button at the top. To configure Talisman to correctly interface with Moonbeam networks on Polkadot.js Apps, you should take the following steps:

1. Check the box next to **Show Ethereum Accounts**
2. Select the accounts you want to connect to Polkadot.js Apps. In this example, it is only **My Ethereum Account**. This is the default name assigned by Talisman which you can rename if you'd like
3. Press **Connect 1**. The value will change depending on the number of accounts you are connecting

![Enable Ethereum/Moonbeam accounts in Talisman.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-4.webp)

Your Talisman wallet is now connected to Polkadot.js Apps. After refreshing Polkadot.js Apps, you should see your Talisman account in the [Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts){target=\_blank}. When launching [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts){target=\_blank} for the first time, you may or may not be connected to the desired network. You can change your selected network to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet by clicking the logo in the top left corner, then scroll down to the **Test Networks** section, select Moonbase Alpha, and scroll back to the top and click **Switch**.

![Connect to Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-5.webp)

After switching, the Polkadot.js site will not only connect to Moonbase Alpha, but also change its styling to make a perfect match.

![Switch to Moonbase Alpha in Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-6.webp)

## Adding a New Account to Talisman {: #adding-a-new-account-to-talisman }

In this section, you'll learn how you can create a new account, or import an already existing MetaMask account to Polkadot.js Apps.

1. Open the Talisman extension and click on the Talisman logo in the upper left hand corner
2. Select **Add Account**
3. Select **New Account**
4. Select **Ethereum** as the account type
5. Give your new account a name
6. Press **Create**

![Create a new Moonbeam account in Talisman.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-7.webp)

Although our new account has been successfully created, Polkadot.js Apps isn't aware of it yet. To connect the new account to Polkadot.js Apps, take the following steps from [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts){target=\_blank}:

1. Open the Talisman extension and Press the **Connected / Not-connected** button
2. Ensure **Show Eth accounts** is checked
3. Click on the account you'd like to connect. The green dot next to the account will light up if it is selected

![Connect Talisman account to Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-8.webp)

## Sending a Transaction Through Substrate's API {: #sending-a-transaction-through-substrates-api }

Now, to demonstrate the potential of Moonbeam's [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} scheme you can make a transfer through the Substrate API using Polkadot.js Apps. Remember that you are interacting with Substrate using an Ethereum-style H160 address. To do so, you can [add another account](#adding-a-new-account-to-talisman). The accounts in Talisman have been renamed to the familiar Alice and Bob accounts. To send some DEV funds from Alice to Bob, take the following steps:

Click on Alice's **send** button, which opens another wizard that guides you through the process of sending a transaction.

1. Set the **send to address**
2. Enter the **amount** to send, which is 4 DEV tokens in this example
3. When ready, click on the **Make Transfer** button
4. Approve the transaction in the Talisman pop up

![Send a Moonbeam transaction through the Substrate API with Talisman.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-9.webp)

After the transaction is confirmed, you should see the balances updated for each account.

![You can see your balances updated in Polkadot.js Apps after a successful transaction.](/images/tokens/connect/talisman/talisman-10.webp)

And that is it! These steps have demonstrated the ease coupled with the robust security of interacting with injected H160 accounts in Polkadot.js Apps with Talisman. All of this is possible because of Moonbeam's unified account structure, a great example of Moonbeam's commitment to providing the best user experience.

# Interacting with Moonbeam Using Trezor Hardware Wallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Hardware wallets provide a safer way to store crypto funds because the private key (used for signing transactions) is stored offline. Trezor offers two hardware wallet solutions at the time of writing: Trezor One and Trezor Model T.

Because Moonbeam is fully Ethereum compatible, you can use your Trezor device to sign transactions on Moonbeam!

This tutorial shows you how to get started with your Trezor hardware wallet on Moonbase Alpha. The guide only illustrates the steps for a Trezor Model T device, but you can follow along with a Trezor One as well.

Please note that your Trezor device will sign transactions in whichever MetaMask network is connected to.

<div class="intro-disclaimer">
  The information presented herein is for informational purposes only and has been provided by third parties. Moonbeam does not endorse any project listed and described on the Moonbeam docs website (https://docs.moonbeam.network/).
</div>

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

Before you get started, update [Trezor Suite](https://suite.trezor.io){target=\_blank} to the latest version available. Also, make sure your Trezor hardware wallet is running the latest firmware. The Trezor wiki offers tutorials on how to update the firmware of both [Trezor One](https://trezor.io/guides/trezor-suite/update-trezor-firmware){target=\_blank} and [Trezor Model T](https://trezor.io/guides/trezor-suite/update-trezor-firmware){target=\_blank} devices.

At the time of writing, the following versions were used:

 - Trezor Suite 21.5.1
 - Trezor One firmware v1.10.0
 - Trezor Model T firmware v2.4.0

In addition, you'll need MetaMask as an intermediary between your Trezor device and Moonbase Alpha. Make sure that your MetaMask is [connected to Moonbase Alpha](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}. Please note that your Trezor device will sign transactions in whichever MetaMask network is connected to.

## Importing your Trezor Account to MetaMask {: #importing-your-trezor-account-to-metamask }

To get started, you need to have set up a wallet (either standard or a hidden wallet). Once you've connected your Trezor device, unlocked it, and set up a wallet in Trezor Suite. Next, to import your Trezor Ethereum account to MetaMask, take the following steps:

 1. Click on the top-right logo to expand the menu
 2. Select **Connect Hardware Wallet**

![MetaMask Connect Hardware Wallet](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum/ledger-2.webp)

Right after, you are prompted to select which hardware wallet you'll like to use in MetaMask. At the moment of writing, only Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets are supported. If you have your Trezor device ready to go, take the following steps:

 1. Select the Trezor logo
 2. Click on **Continue**

![MetaMask Select Trezor Hardware Wallet](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-2.webp)

After clicking the button, a new tab named **TrezorConnect** should show up, where you'll need to pair your device. This is not required if you've Trezor Suite opened and your device is connected. Here, click on **Pair devices**.

![Trezor Hardware Wallet Connect Pair Device](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-3.webp)

On the next screen, take the following steps:

 1. Click on **Check for devices.** This will open a menu showing which Trezor device (if available) you want to connect to
 2. Select the Trezor device you want to use
 3. Click on **Connect**

![Trezor Hardware Wallet Connect Wizard Select and Connect Device](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-4.webp)

Once your device is connected, you need to allow MetaMask to read its public keys. Therefore, click on **Allow once for this session**. Optionally, you can also check the **Don't ask me again** box.

![Trezor Hardware Wallet Connect Wizard Allow Read Public Keys](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-5.webp)

Next, you are asked if you want to export the public key of your Ethereum account (tab was cropped and labeled as 1 in the following image). Right after, you are prompted with an option to use [Trezor's passphrase option (tab cropped and labeled as 2 in the image). If you want to use the default wallet, just click on **Enter**. If not, please follow [Trezor's wiki article for passphrase wallets](https://trezor.io/learn/a/passphrases-and-hidden-wallets){target=\_blank}.

![Trezor Hardware Wallet Connect Wizard Allow Export and Passphrase](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-6.webp)

If MetaMask was able to connect successfully to your Trezor device, you should see a list of five Ethereum-styled accounts. If not, please double-check that you've properly connected your Trezor device to the computer and it is unlocked. You can also repeat the process with the Trezor Suite app opened.

From this list of five Ethereum accounts, take the following steps:

 1. Select the accounts you would like to import from your Trezor device
 2. Click on **Unlock**

![Trezor Select Ethereum Accounts to Import](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-7.webp)

If you've imported your Trezor Ethereum-styled account successfully, you should see it displayed in the main MetaMask screen like shown in the following image:

![MetaMask Successfully Imported Trezor Account](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-8.webp)

You've now successfully imported a Moonbeam compatible account from your Trezor device and are now ready to start [signing transactions using your hardware wallet](#signing-a-transaction-using-your-trezor).

## Signing a Transaction Using your Trezor {: #signing-a-transaction-using-your-trezor }

If you've successfully [imported your Trezor account to MetaMask](#importing-your-trezor-account-to-metamask), you are ready to sign transactions on Moonbeam using your Trezor device. This tutorial will show you how to send a simple transaction on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, but it applies to other Moonbeam ecosystem networks.

First, make sure your Trezor account is [funded with DEV tokens](/builders/get-started/networks/moonbase/#get-tokens){target=\_blank}. Next, click on the **Send** button.

![MetaMask Trezor Account Funded](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-9.webp)

A `TrezorConnect` tab should pop up, asking permission to read public keys from your device and prepare your Trezor for transaction and data signing. Once you are ready, click on **Allow once for this session**. Optionally, you can also check the **Don't ask me again** box.

![Trezor Hardware Wallet Allow Read Public Keys and Signing](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-10.webp)

As you would in a standard transaction, set the recipient address, enter the number of tokens to send, review transaction details and confirm it. This will initiate the transaction signature wizard in your Trezor device. Here, take the following steps:

 1. Review all transaction details. Please note that the token corresponds to the network MetaMask is connected to. **In this case, it is DEV tokens and not UNKN!**
 2. Once all details have been checked, hold the button to confirm

!!! note
    At the time of writing, the token name for all Moonbeam-related networks is always shown as `UNKN`. Please note that the token being handled is the one corresponding to the network MetaMask is connected to.

![Trezor Hardware Wallet Sign Transaction](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-11.webp)

Right after you've approved the transaction, MetaMask sends it to the network. Once the transaction is confirmed, it will be displayed as **Send** on MetaMask's main screen.

![MetaMask Trezor Transaction Wizard](/images/tokens/connect/trezor/trezor-12.webp)

And that is it! You've signed a transaction on Moonbase Alpha using your Trezor hardware wallet.

The process of interacting with smart contracts using your Trezor device is similar. Make sure to double-check the data being signed on your Trezor device before confirming the transaction.

# Managing your Account Identity

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The [Substrate](/learn/platform/technology/#substrate-framework){target=\_blank} Identity pallet is an out-of-the-box solution for adding personal information to your on-chain account. Personal information can include default fields such as your legal name, display name, website, Twitter handle, Riot (now known as Element) name. You can also take advantage of custom fields to include any other relevant information.

Once your identity information is on-chain, you can request verification of your identity from a registrar. A registrar will perform proper due diligence to verify the submitted identity information and based on their findings will provide their judgement on-chain and a green check mark will appear next to your account.

This guide will show you how to set an identity, clear it, and request judgement on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. This guide can also be adapted to be used on Moonbeam and Moonriver.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

To store your information on-chain, you must bond some funds, which eventually will be returned once the identity has been cleared. There are two categories of fields: default and custom. If custom fields are used, you will be required to submit an additional deposit for each field.

- **Default fields include** - your legal name, display name, website, Twitter handle, Riot (now known as Element) name

- **Custom fields include** - any other relevant information. For example, you could include your Discord handle

## Checking Prerequisites { : #checking-prerequisites }

For this guide, you will need the following:

- To connect to the [Moonbase Alpha TestNet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} on the Polkadot.js Apps explorer. You can also follow along and adapt the instructions for [Moonbeam](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} or [Moonriver](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonriver.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}.
- To [create or import an account](/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/#creating-or-importing-an-h160-account) into Polkadot.js Apps
- Make sure you have funded your account.
 You can get DEV tokens for testing on Moonbase Alpha once every 24 hours from the [Moonbase Alpha Faucet](https://faucet.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}

## Get Started {: #get-started }

There are a couple different ways to set and clear an identity using the Polkadot.js Apps, depending on the information to be included. If you intend to register your identity using only the default fields, you can follow the instructions for [Managing an Identity via the Accounts UI](#manage-via-accounts). **This is the recommended way to set and manage your identity**.

If you are looking for a more customizable experience and want to add custom fields beyond the default fields, you can follow the instructions for [Managing an Identity via the Extrinsics UI](#manage-via-extrinsics).

!!! note
    Please note that it is recommended to use the **Accounts** UI on Polkadot.js Apps to manage your identity as it provides an easy-to-use interface that enforces character limits. If you use the **Extrinsics** UI, please be aware that your input for each field (i.e, name, email, etc.) must be 32 characters or less, otherwise, your information will be cut off.

## Manage an Identity via Accounts {: #manage-via-accounts }

### Set an Identity {: #set-identity-accounts }

To get started with setting an identity using the Accounts UI, head to the [Accounts tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/accounts){target=\_blank} on the Polkadot.js Apps explorer.

You should already have an account connected, so you can go ahead and click on your account name to verify and take note of your balances. After you send the transaction to set an identity, the deposit(s) you submitted will be moved from your transferable balance to your reserved balance.

![Starting account balances](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-1.webp)

To set your identity, you'll need to:

1. Click on the 3 vertical dots next to the account you would like to set an identity for
2. A menu will pop up. Click **Set on-chain identity**

![Set on-chain identity](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-2.webp)

Next, the menu to register and set your identity will pop-up and you can start filling in your information. You are not required to enter information for every single field, you can choose to fill in just one field or all of them, it's up to you. For this example:

1. Set your display name
2. Click on the **include field** toggle for email and then enter in your email
3. Click on the **include field** toggle for Twitter and then enter in your Twitter handle
4. After you're done filling in your information and the deposit amount looks alright to you, click **Set Identity**

![Set your identity](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-3.webp)

You will then be prompted to sign the transaction. If everything looks good, you can enter your password and click **Sign and Submit** to sign and send the transaction.

You should see status notifications pop-up in the top right hand corner. Once the transaction has been confirmed, you can click on your account name again and the panel will slide out on the right side of the page. Your balances will have changed, and you’ll also see your new identity information.

![Updated account balances](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-4.webp)

If the identity information matches what you entered, you’ve successfully set an identity!

Once you clear your identity, the deposit in your reserved balance will get transferred back to your transferable balance. If you need to make changes to your identity, you can go through the process of setting your identity again. Please note that you will need to ensure all fields are re-entered, even if only one field needs to be changed, or they will be overwritten. You will not need to pay another deposit, unless custom fields are used, but you will need to pay gas fees.

### Clear an Identity {: #clear-identity-accounts }

To clear your identity from the [Accounts tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/accounts){target=\_blank} of the Polkadot.js Apps UI, you'll need to:

1. Click on the 3 vertical dots next to the account you would like to add identity information for
2. A menu will pop up. Click **Set on-chain identity**

![Set on-chain identity](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-5.webp)

The identity menu will pop-up with your information already filled out. You'll need to click **Clear Identity**.

![Clear identity](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-6.webp)

You will then be prompted to sign the transaction. If everything looks good, you can enter your password and click **Sign and Submit** to sign and send the transaction.

You should see status notifications pop-up in the top right hand corner. Once the transaction has been confirmed, you can click on your account name again and the panel will slide out on the right side of the page. You can see your reserved balance was transferred back to your transferable balance, and your identity information has been removed.

That’s it! You’ve successfully cleared your identity. If you want to add a new identity, you can do so at any time.

## Manage an Identity via Extrinsics {: #manage-via-extrinsics }

### Set an Identity {: #set-identity-extrinsics }

To register an identity using the extrinsics UI, navigate to the [Extrinsics page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} on Polkadot.js Apps. Then, you'll need to:

1. Select your account
2. Select identity from the **submit the following extrinsic** dropdown
3. Then select the **setIdentity(info)** function
4. Start filling in your identity information. Please make sure that for each field, your input does not exceed 32 characters
    1. Select the format of the data. For this example, you can use **Raw** data but you also have the option of entering your data in BlackTwo256, Sha256, Keccak256, and ShaThree256 hashed format
    2. Enter the data in that format

![Set your identity using the Extrinsics UI](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-7.webp)

Optionally, if you would like to enter custom fields, you can do so by:

1. Scrolling to the top and clicking on **Add item**
2. Two fields will appear: the first for the field name and the second for the value. Please make sure that for each field and value, your input does not exceed 32 characters. Fill in the field name
    1. Select the format of the data for the field name. Again, you can use **Raw** data
    2. Enter the field name in the selected format
3. Fill in the value
    1. Select the format of the data for the value. Again, you can use **Raw** data
    2. Enter the value in the selected format

![Add custom fields](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-8.webp)

Finally, once all of your identity information has been added, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Submit Transaction**.

![Submit identity information](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-9.webp)

You will then be prompted to sign the transaction. Remember, there is an additional deposit required for each additional custom field. If everything looks good, you can enter your password and click **Sign and Submit** to sign and send the transaction.

You should see status notifications pop-up in the top right hand corner confirming the transaction. If successful, you’ve set an identity! Congratulations! To make sure everything went through and your identity information looks good, next you can confirm your identity.

### Confirm an Identity {: #confirm-identity-extrinsics }

To verify the addition of your identity information, you can click on the **Developer** tab and then navigate to [Chain state](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/chainstate){target=\_blank}.

On the **Chain State** UI, make sure **Storage** is selected. Then you can start to request your identity information:

1. Set **selected state query** to **identity**
2. Select the **identityOf(AccountId)** function
3. Select your account
4. Click the **+** button to get your identity information

![Request identity information](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-10.webp)

You can see now that you’ve successfully set an identity! Once you clear your identity, the deposit in your reserved balance will get transferred back to your transferable balance. If you need to make changes to your identity, you can go through the process of setting your identity again. Please note that you will need to ensure all fields are re-entered, even if only one field needs to be changed, or they will be overwritten. You will not need to pay another deposit, unless custom fields are used, but you will need to pay gas fees.

### Clear an Identity {: #clear-identity-extrinsics }

To clear your identity from the [Extrinsics tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} of the Polkadot.js Apps UI, you'll need to:

1. Select your account from the **using the selected account** dropdown
2. Select **identity** from the **submit the following extrinsic** dropdown
3. Then select the **clearIdentity()** function
4. Click **Submit Transaction**

![Clear an identity using the Extrinsics UI](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-11.webp)

You will then be prompted to sign the transaction. If everything looks good, you can enter your password and click **Sign and Submit** to sign and send the transaction.

You should see status notifications pop-up in the top right hand corner confirming the transaction.

To verify the removal of your identity information, you can follow the steps in the [Confirm an Identity](#confirm-identity-extrinsics) section again. Instead of seeing your identity information, this time you'll get a response of **none**. Meaning, you no longer have any identity information associated with your account. If you check your balances, you should see that the initial deposit for setting your identity has been returned to your transferable balance. That’s it! Your identity has been cleared.

## Identity Judgement {: #identity-judgement }

After submitting your identity information, you can request verification of your identity from a registrar. Registrars are tasked with verifying the submitted identity information and can set a fee for their services. When you request judgement, you'll need to specify the registrar you want to verify your information and the maximum fee that you're willing to pay them for providing judgement. The request will only be processed if the selected registrar charges less than the maximum fee that you specified, otherwise the transaction will fail. The fee will be locked until the registrar completes the judgement process and only then will the fee be transferred to the registrar. The registrar fee is in addition to the deposit paid when you initially created your identity.

Registrar applicants are appointed via on-chain democracy. If an appointed registrar issues incorrect judgements or proves to be untrustworthy, they can be removed through democracy.

A registrar will perform proper due diligence to verify the submitted identity information and based on their findings will provide judgement and assign up to seven levels of confidence:

- **Unknown** - no judgement made yet. This is the default value
- **Fee Paid** - indicates a user has requested judgement and it is in progress
- **Reasonable** - the information appears reasonable, but no in-depth checks were performed using legal identity documents
- **Known Good** - the information is correct and is based upon review of legal identity documents
- **Out of Date** - the information used to be good, but is now out of date
- **Low Quality** - the information is low quality or imprecise, but can be updated as needed
- **Erroneous** - the information is erroneous and may indicate malicious intent. This state cannot be modified and can only be removed if the entire identity has been removed

### Current Registrars {: #current-registrars }

When requesting identity judgement, you'll need to provide the index of the registrar you want to complete your request.

The current registrars are as follows:

You can get a complete list of the current registrars, including the fees that each registrar charges, by heading to [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}, selecting the **Developer** tab, choosing **Chain State** from the dropdown, and taking the following steps:

1. Select the **identity** pallet
2. Choose the **registrars** extrinsic
3. Click the **+** button

![View registrar list](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-12.webp)

### Request Identity Judgement {: #request-judgement }

To request identity judgement, from the **Extrinsics** page, you can take the following steps:

1. Select your account from the **using the selected account** dropdown
2. Select **identity** from the **submit the following extrinsic** dropdown
3. Then select the **requestJudgement()** function
4. Enter the index of the registrar you want to review and provide judgement on your identity information
5. Enter the maximum fee you're willing to pay in Wei. This must be higher than the fee set by the registrar, otherwise the transaction will fail
6. Click **Submit Transaction**

![Request identity judgement](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-13.webp)

Once the transaction goes through, the fee will be taken from your free balance and locked until the judgement is complete.

After the judgement is complete and you've been successfully verified, a green check mark will appear next to your account. If successful, your identity will be assigned one of these three levels of confidence: low quality, reasonable, or known good. From the **Accounts** page, you can click on your account name to review your identity information and your identity judgement results.

![Identity verified](/images/tokens/manage/identity/identity-14.webp)

## Introduction {: #introduction } 

A single-signature wallet, or singlesig for short, is a wallet in which only one owner holds the private key, and therefore has control over all the assets that account holds. Moreover, if the private key is lost, then access to the wallet and the funds are lost forever. 

To solve this problem, multi-signature wallets, or multisig for short, have been introduced. With a multisig wallet there is more than one owner, so one owner could lose their keys and the others would still have access to the wallet and funds. In addition, multisig wallets can require threshold signing, where a proposal is only executed as a transaction if a certain amount of approvals are attained. Therefore creating an extra layer of security.

To help manage singlesig and multisig wallets, [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io){target=\_blank} was forked to create [Moonbeam Safe](https://multisig.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}. The Safe can be configured as a multisig contract that allows two or more owners to hold and transfer funds to and from the Safe. You can also configure the Safe to be a singlesig contract with only one owner. 

This guide will show you how to create a multisig Safe on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. You will also learn how to send DEV and ERC-20 tokens to and from the Safe, and how to interact with smart contracts using the Safe. This guide can be adapted for Moonbeam and Moonriver.

<div class="intro-disclaimer">
  The information presented herein is for informational purposes only and has been provided by third parties. Moonbeam does not endorse any project listed and described on the Moonbeam docs website (https://docs.moonbeam.network/).
</div>

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

Before diving into the guide, you'll need to have a few [MetaMask accounts](#metamask-accounts) loaded up with funds, some [ERC-20 tokens](#erc20-tokens) on hand to send to the Safe, and a [deployed smart contract](#deployed-smart-contract) to interact with.

### MetaMask Accounts {: #metamask-accounts }

For this guide, you will be creating a Safe on Moonbase Alpha to interact and manage your funds with. To connect to the Safe, you will need to have:

 - MetaMask installed and [connected to Moonbase Alpha](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}
 - At least two accounts each loaded with funds.
 You can get DEV tokens for testing on Moonbase Alpha once every 24 hours from the [Moonbase Alpha Faucet](https://faucet.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}

You will need at least two accounts because you will be setting up a multisig Safe with 3 owners, and 2/3 confirmations for any transaction to get executed. Therefore, throughout this guide you will need to switch back and forth between at least two of the accounts to be able to confirm and send transactions. 

This guide will use the following accounts:

 - **Alice** — 0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac
 - **Bob** — 0x3Cd0A705a2DC65e5b1E1205896BaA2be8A07c6e0
 - **Charlie** — 0x798d4Ba9baf0064Ec19eB4F0a1a45785ae9D6DFc

### ERC-20 Tokens {: #erc20-tokens }

Later on in this guide, you will be learning how to send and receive ERC-20 tokens to and from the Safe. So you will need to have deployed some ERC-20 tokens and added them to your MetaMask account. To do so, you can check out the [Using Remix to Deploy to Moonbeam](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} guide, in particular the [Deploying a Contract to Moonbeam](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/#deploying-a-contract-to-moonbeam-using-remix){target=\_blank} and [Interact with a Moonbeam-based ERC-20](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/#interacting-with-a-moonbeam-based-erc-20-from-metamask){target=\_blank} sections will show you how to deploy an ERC-20 token and import it into MetaMask.

### Deployed Smart Contract {: #deployed-smart-contract }

Towards the end of this guide, you will be learning how to interact with a smart contract using the Safe. So you will need to have a smart contract deployed to interact with. If you would like detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Deploying a Contract to Moonbeam using Remix](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/#deploying-a-contract-to-moonbeam){target=\_blank} guide.

You can head to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank} and create a new file for the following `SetText.sol` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SetText {
    string public text;
    
    function setTextData(string calldata _text) public {
        text = _text;
    }
}
```

This is a simple contract with a single function, `setTextData`, that accepts a string and uses it to set the `text` variable.

You will need the contract address and the ABI, so make sure you have copied those somewhere or have access to them for later on.

## Create a Safe {: #create-a-safe }

To get started creating a Safe, navigate to the [Moonbeam Safe](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/?chain=mbase){target=\_blank}. For the purpose of this guide, you'll create a Safe on Moonbase Alpha, but you can also adapt the instructions to create a Safe on [Moonbeam](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/?chain=mbeam){target=\_blank} or [Moonriver](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/?chain=mriver){target=\_blank}. To switch networks, simply click the network dropdown in the top right hand corner of the page. 

### Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

Once on the [Moonbase Alpha](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/?chain=mbase){target=\_blank} page, you can begin to create a Safe by first connecting your wallet:

 1. Click **Connect Wallet**
 2. Select a wallet to connect to Moonbeam Safe. For this example you can use MetaMask. If MetaMask doesn't appear in the list of options, click **Show More** and select **MetaMask**

![Connect Wallet to Moonbeam Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-1.webp)

If you're not already signed into MetaMask, you will be prompted to sign in. You will then be guided through adding and connecting your accounts, and adding and switching to the Moonbase Alpha network:

 1. Select an account and connect to the Safe. You'll want to select at least 2 of the 3 owner accounts and then click **Next**. For this example, Alice, Bob, and Charlie's accounts have all been selected 
 2. Connect to the selected accounts by clicking **Connect**
 3. If you are not connected to Moonbase Alpha, nor do you have the network added to your MetaMask, add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network by clicking **Approve**
 4. Switch the network to Moonbase Alpha by click **Switch Network**

![Connect MetaMask to Moonbase Alpha](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-2.webp)

Now, in the top right hand corner, you can confirm you are connected to your MetaMask account on the Moonbase Alpha network. If you're using the development accounts, you should see Alice's account address. If not, double check your MetaMask and switch to Alice's account.

### Create New Safe {: #create-new-safe }

To create a new Safe on Moonbase Alpha, click **Create new Safe**. You will be taken to a wizard that will walk you through creating your new Safe. By going through these steps and creating your Safe, you are consenting to the terms of use and the privacy policy. So, feel free to look those over before getting started.

![Create Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-3.webp)

You will need to give your Safe a name:

 1. Enter the name of your new Safe, you can use `moonbeam-tutorial`
 2. Click **Start**

![Submit Safe Name](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-4.webp)

Next up is the owners and confirmations section of the wizard. In this section, you will add the owners of the Safe and specify the threshold. The threshold determines how many of the owners are required to confirm a transaction before the transaction gets executed. 

There are many different setups that can be used when creating a Safe. There can be 1 or more owners of the Safe as well as varying threshold levels. Please note that it is not advised to create a Safe with just 1 owner as it creates the possibility of a single point of failure.

For this guide, you will create a multisig setup that has 3 owners and requires a threshold of 2, so at least 2 out of the 3 owners keys are required to execute transactions through the Safe.

Your account will automatically be prefilled in as the first owner, however this can be changed if you would like to use different accounts. For this example, Alice's account has been prefilled. In addition to Alice, you can also add Bob and Charlie as owners:

 1. Click **Add another owner**
 2. Enter **Bob** as the second owner, along with his address: `0x3Cd0A705a2DC65e5b1E1205896BaA2be8A07c6e0`
 3. Enter **Charlie** as the third owner, along with his address: `0x798d4Ba9baf0064Ec19eB4F0a1a45785ae9D6DFc`
 4. Set the confirmation threshold to **2** out of 3 owners
 5. Click **Review** to go to the last step in the wizard

![Enter Safe Owners](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-5.webp)

Finally, you can review all of the Safe and owner details and if everything looks ok:

 1. Click **Submit** to create your new Safe. The creation of the Safe will cost approximately less than .001 DEV tokens on Moonbase Alpha. MetaMask will pop-up and prompt you to confirm the transaction
 2. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction and create the Safe

![Send Transaction to Create Multisig Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-6.webp)

It could take a few minutes to process the transaction and create the Safe, but once it has been created you should see a message saying "Your Safe was created successfully". From there, you can click **Get Started** to load your Safe and start interacting with it.

![Safe Created Successfully](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-7.webp)

## Configure Safe {: #configure-safe }

You can always manage your Safe and change some of the parameters set when creating it. To do so, you can click on the **Settings** option on the left-hand side menu. 

![Modify Safe Settings](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-8.webp)

In there you have the following options:

 - **Safe Details** — allows you to change the Safe name. This is a local action that requires no on-chain interaction
 - **Owners** — allows you to initiate a on-chain proposal to add/remove owners to the Safe
 - **Policies** — allows you to initiate a on-chain proposal to change the multisig threshold to execute the proposal as a transaction
 - **Advanced** — allows you to check other parameters from the Safe, such as the nonce, modules, and transaction guard
 
## Receive and Send Tokens {: #receive-and-send-tokens }

### Receive Tokens {: #receive-tokens }

Now that you have created your Safe, you can start interacting with it. First, load up the Safe by sending some DEV tokens to it. You can send funds to the Safe from any account with DEV tokens. For this example, you can use Alice's account. Hover over **DEV** in the list of assets to reveal the **Send** and **Receive** buttons. Then click **Receive**.

![Receive Tokens to the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-9.webp)

A pop-up will appear with the address of the Safe. Copy the address and click **Done**. 

![Copy Safe Address](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-10.webp)

Next, open up your MetaMask to initiate a transaction:

 1. Click **Send** to send a transaction
 2. Paste in the address of the Safe
 3. Enter the amount of DEV tokens you would like to send to the Safe. For this example, you can use 2 DEV tokens
 4. Click **Next**
 5. Review the details of the transaction and click **Confirm**

![Send DEV Tokens to the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-11.webp)

The transaction will be sent and your balance for DEV tokens will be updated on the Safe. 

### Send Tokens {: #send-tokens }

Now that you have funds in the Safe, you can send funds from the Safe to another account. For this example, you can send 1 DEV token to Bob's address. Hover over **DEV** in the list of assets, and this time click on **Send**.

![Send Tokens from the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-12.webp)

A pop-up will appear where you can enter the recipient and the amount of DEV tokens to send:

 1. Enter Bob's Address
 2. Select **DEV** from the list of assets
 3. Enter 1 DEV token
 4. Click **Review**

![Send 1 DEV Token from the Safe to Bob](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-13.webp)

 1. Review the details and click **Submit**. MetaMask will pop-up and you'll notice that instead of sending a transaction, you're sending a message
 2. Click **Sign** to sign the message

![Submit Transaction and Sign Message](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-14.webp)

Now, if you go back to the Safe, under the **Transactions** tab, you should be able to see that there has been a transaction proposal initiated to send 1 DEV tokens to Bob's address. However, you should also see that only 1 out of 2 confirmations have been received and that 1 more owner is required to confirm the transaction before it gets executed. 

![Transaction Needs Confirmations](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-15.webp)

### Transaction Confirmation {: #transaction-confirmation }

The process of confirming (or rejecting) a transaction proposal is similar for all the use cases of a multisig Safe. One of the owners initiates the proposal to execute an action. The other owners can approve or reject the proposal. Once the signature threshold is reached, any owner can execute the transaction proposal if approved, or discard the transaction proposal if rejected.

In this example, if 2 of the 3 owners decided to reject the proposal, then the assets would remain in the Safe. However, in this case, you can confirm the transaction from either Bob's or Charlie's account.

Switch accounts in MetaMask to Bob's account (or Charlie's). Then go back to the Safe connected as Bob. The **Confirm** button should now be enabled. As Bob, go ahead and click **Confirm** to meet the threshold and send the transaction. A pop-up will appear for you to approve the transaction:

 1. Check the **Execute transaction** box to execute the transaction immediately after confirmation. You can un-check it for the transaction to be executed manually at a later time
 2. Click **Submit**
 3. MetaMask will pop-up and ask you to confirm the transaction, if everything looks good, you can click **Confirm**

!!! note
    If you receive an error stating the transaction might fail, you may need to increase the gas limit. You can do so either in the **Advanced options** or in MetaMask. 

![Submit Transaction Confirmation](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-16.webp)

The transaction will be removed from the **QUEUE** tab and a record of the transaction can now be found under the **HISTORY** tab. In addition, Bob's balance has now increased by 1 DEV token, and the Safe's balance for DEV tokens has decreased.

![Successfully Executed Transaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-17.webp)

Congratulations, you've successfully received and sent DEV tokens to and from the Safe!

## Receive and Send ERC-20 Tokens {: #receive-and-send-erc20-tokens }

### Receive ERC-20 Tokens {: #receive-erc20-tokens }

Next up is to receive and send ERC-20s to and from the Safe. You should already have loaded up your MetaMask with **MYTOK** ERC-20 tokens. If not, please refer back to the [ERC-20 Tokens](#erc20-tokens) section of the prerequisites.

You should still be connected to Bob's account for this example. So, you'll be sending MYTOK tokens from Bob's account to the Safe.

You'll need to get the Safe's address again, you can do so by clicking on the **Copy to clipboard** icon in the top left hand corner. Once you've got your Safe's address copied, open up MetaMask:

 1. Switch to the **Assets** tab and select **MYTOK** from the list
 2. Click **Send** 
 3. Paste in the Safe's address
 4. Enter amount of MYTOKs to send. You should have minted 8M MYTOK tokens in the [Using Remix to Deploy to Moonbeam](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} guide. So for this example, you can enter 1000 MYTOKs for the amount to send
 5. Click **Next**
 6. Review the transaction details and then click **Confirm** to send the transaction.

![Send ERC-20s to the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-18.webp)

If you navigate back to the Safe, in the list of **Assets** you should now see **MyToken** and a balance of 1000 MYTOKs. It could take a few minutes for **MyToken** to appear, but there is nothing for you to do to add the asset, it will appear on it's own.

### Send ERC-20 Tokens {: #send-erc20-tokens }

Now that you have loaded your Safe with MYTOKs, you can send some from the Safe to another account. For this example, you can send 10 MYTOKs to Charlie.  

Hover over **MyToken** in the list of assets, and this time click on **Send**.

![Send ERC-20s from the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-19.webp)

A pop-up will appear where you can enter the recipient and the amount of MYTOK tokens to send:

 1. Enter Charlies's Address
 2. Select **MyToken** from the list of assets
 3. Enter 10 MYTOK tokens
 4. Click **Review** and review the details

![Send ERC-20s to Charlie from the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-20.webp)

If everything looks ok, you can: 

 1. Click **Submit**. MetaMask will pop-up and you'll notice that instead of sending a transaction, you're sending a message
 2. Click **Sign** to sign the message

![Sign Message to Send ERC-20s to Charlie from the Safe](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-21.webp)

Now, if you go back to the Safe, under the **Transactions** tab, you should be able to see that there has been a transaction proposal initiated to send 10 MYTOK tokens to Charlie's address. However, you should also see that only 1 out of 2 confirmations have been received and that 1 more owner is required to confirm the transaction before it gets executed.

![Transaction Needs Confirmation](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-22.webp)

You will need to switch accounts to Alice or Charlie and confirm the transaction to execute it. You can follow the same steps outlined in the above [Transaction Confirmation](#transaction-confirmation) section.

Once the transaction has been confirmed from one of the other two accounts, the transaction will be moved to the **HISTORY** tab. 

![Successfully Executed Transaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-23.webp)

Congratulations! You've successfully received and sent ERC-20 tokens to and from the Safe!

## Interact with a Smart Contract {: #interact-with-a-smart-contract }

For this section, you will be interacting with a smart contract using the Safe. You should have already deployed the `SetText.sol` contract using Remix, if not please refer back to the [Deployed Smart Contract](#deployed-smart-contract) section of the prerequisites.

You should still be connected to Alice's account for this section of the guide.

From the Safe:

 1. On the left hand side click on **New Transaction**
 2. Then select **Contract interaction**

![New Contract Interaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-24.webp)

The **Contract interaction** pop-up will appear and you can fill in the contract details:

 1. Enter the contract address into the **Contract address** field
 2. In the **ABI** text box, paste the ABI
 3. A **Method** dropdown will appear. Select the `setTextData` function
 4. Then a `_text` input field will appear. You can enter anything you would like, for this example, you can use `polkadots and moonbeams`
 5. Click **Review**

![Create Contract Interaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-25.webp)

If the details look ok, go ahead and:

 1. Click **Submit**. MetaMask will pop-up and you'll notice that instead of sending a transaction, you're sending a message
 2. Click **Sign** to sign the message

![Submit Contract Interaction](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-26.webp)

Now, if you go back to the Safe, under the **Transactions** tab, you should be able to see that there has been a transaction proposal initiated for a **Contract interaction**. However, you should also see that only 1 out of 2 confirmations have been received and that 1 more owner is required to confirm the transaction before it gets executed.

![Transaction Needs Confirmation](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-27.webp)

You will need to switch accounts to Bob or Charlie and confirm the transaction to execute it. You can follow the same steps outlined in the above [Transaction Confirmation](#transaction-confirmation) section.

Once the transaction has been confirmed from one of the other two accounts, the transaction will be moved to the **HISTORY** tab.

![Transaction History](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-28.webp)

To double check that the correct text was set, you can go through the process again except instead of selecting **setTextData** from the **Method** dropdown, you can select **text** to read the `text` value. This will be a call instead of a transaction, so a **Call** button will appear. Click on it and directly within the pop-up, you should see the result of the call, `polkadots and moonbeams`.

![Contract Interaction Call Result](/images/tokens/manage/multisig-safe/safe-29.webp)

Congratulations, you've successfully interacted with a smart contract using the Safe!

## Using Moonbeam Safe APIs {: #using-moonbeam-safe-apis }

description: Learn how to set up a proxy account on Moonbeam-based networks so you can keep your underlying account safe in cold storage.
categories: Tokens and Accounts
---

# Setting up a Proxy Account

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Proxy accounts can be set up to perform a limited number of actions on behalf of users and are useful for keeping the underlying accounts safe. They allow users to keep their primary account secured safely in cold storage while enabling the proxy to actively perform functions and participate in the network with the weight of the tokens in the primary account.

Proxy accounts can be set up to perform specific Substrate functions such as author mapping, staking, balances, and more. This can allow you to, for example, grant a trusted individual access to perform collator or delegator functions on your behalf. A proxy could also be used to keep a staking account safe in cold storage.

This guide will show you how to set up a proxy account on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet for balance transfers and how to execute a proxy transaction.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have:

- [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank} open and connected to Moonbase Alpha
- Create or have two accounts on Moonbase Alpha
- At least one of the accounts must be funded with `DEV` tokens.
 You can get DEV tokens for testing on Moonbase Alpha once every 24 hours from the [Moonbase Alpha Faucet](https://faucet.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}

If you need help importing your accounts into Polkadot.js Apps, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using Polkadot.js Apps](/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/#creating-or-importing-an-h160-account){target=\_blank} guide.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

When setting up a proxy account, a bond for the proxy is taken out of your free balance and moved to your reserved balance. The bond is required as adding a proxy requires on-chain storage space, and it is recalculated for each proxy you add or remove. After all proxies are removed from your account, the bond is returned to your free balance.

The deposit is calculated based on a deposit base and a deposit factor:

- **Deposit base** - the amount to be reserved for an account to have a proxy list
- **Deposit factor** - the additional amount to be reserved for every proxy the primary account has

The equation for calculating the deposit is:

```text
deposit base + deposit factor * number of proxies
```

=== "Moonbeam"
    |    Variable    |                       Value                       |
    |:--------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
    |  Deposit base  |  {{ networks.moonbeam.proxy.deposit_base }} GLMR  |
    | Deposit factor | {{ networks.moonbeam.proxy.deposit_factor }} GLMR |
    |  Max proxies   | {{ networks.moonbeam.proxy.max_proxies }} proxies |

=== "Moonriver"
    |    Variable    |                       Value                        |
    |:--------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
    |  Deposit base  |  {{ networks.moonriver.proxy.deposit_base }} MOVR  |
    | Deposit factor | {{ networks.moonriver.proxy.deposit_factor }} MOVR |
    |  Max proxies   | {{ networks.moonriver.proxy.max_proxies }} proxies |

=== "Moonbase Alpha"
    |    Variable    |                       Value                       |
    |:--------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|

    | Deposit factor | {{ networks.moonbase.proxy.deposit_factor }} DEV  |
    |  Max proxies   | {{ networks.moonbase.proxy.max_proxies }} proxies |

## Proxy Types {: #proxy-types }

When creating a proxy account, you must choose a type of proxy which will define how the proxy can be used. The available options are:

- **`AuthorMapping`** - this type of proxy account is used by collators to migrate services from one server to another
- **`CancelProxy`** - allows the proxy account to reject and remove any announced proxy calls
- **`Staking`** - allows the proxy account to perform staking-related transactions, such as collator or delegator functions, including `authorMapping()`
- **`Governance`** - allows the proxy account to make transactions related to governance, such as voting or proposing democracy proposals
- **`NonTransfer`** - this type of proxy account is allowed to submit any type of transaction with the exception of balance transfers
- **`Balances`** - allows the proxy account to only make transactions related to sending funds
- **`IdentityJudgement`** - allows the proxy account to request judgement on an [account's identity](/tokens/manage/identity/){target=\_blank} from a registrar. The following judgements can be issued:
    - **unknown** - (default) no judgement has been made yet
    - **fee paid** - to indicate a user has requested judgement and it is in progress
    - **reasonable** - the information appears reasonable, but no in-depth checks (i.e. formal KYC process) were performed
    - **known good** - the information has been certified as correct
    - **out of date** - the information used to be good, but is now out of date
    - **low quality** - the information is low quality or imprecise, but can be fixed with an update
    - **erroneous** - the information is erroneous and may indicate malicious intent
- **`Any`** - allows the proxy account to use any function supported by the proxy pallet

For the purposes of this guide, you will be setting up a proxy account using the balances proxy type. Since this type enables the proxy to spend funds on behalf of the primary account, you should exercise caution and only provide access to accounts you trust. The proxy will have access to transfer all of the funds within the primary account, and if not trusted, the proxy could drain the primary account. Also make sure not to forget to remove the proxy as needed.

## Creating a Proxy Account {: #creating-a-proxy-account }


### Via the Moonbeam DApp {: #create-via-the-moonbeam-dapp }

It's easy to create a proxy account on [the Moonbeam dApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam/proxy){target=\_blank}. To do so, take the following steps:

1. Toggle the network switcher button to select your desired network
2. Navigate to the **Proxy** page
3. Ensure you're connected with the primary account that you wish to add a proxy of  
4. Enter the address you want to delegate proxy control to
5. From the **proxyType** dropdown, choose the desired proxy type, such as a balances proxy
6. Optionally, you can add a time delay using a specified number of blocks, which could allow time for the primary account to review the pending transaction
7. Click **Add Proxy** and confirm the transaction in your wallet

![Add a proxy account via Apps.Moonbeam.Network](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-1.webp)

### Via Polkadot.js Apps {: #create-via-polkadot-js-apps }

There are a couple of ways you can create proxy accounts in [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}, either from the **Extrinsics** page or the **Accounts** page. However, to create a time-delayed proxy, you will need to use the **Extrinsics** page. A time delay provides an additional layer of security to proxies by specifying a delay period based on a number of blocks. This will prevent the proxy account from executing a transaction until the delay period ends. The delay allows time for the primary account that controls the proxy to review pending transactions, potentially for malicious actions, and cancel if necessary before execution.

To get started creating your proxy account, head to the **Developer** tab and select [**Extrinsics**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} from the dropdown. Next, you will need to take the following steps:

1. Select the primary account
2. From the **submit the following extrinsic** dropdown, select **proxy**
3. Choose the **addProxy** extrinsic
4. Select the **delegate** account for the proxy
5. From the **proxyType** dropdown, choose **Balances**
6. Optionally, you can add a time delay using a specified number of blocks, which could allow time for the primary account to review the pending transaction
7. Click **Submit Transaction**

![Add a proxy account from the Extrinsics page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-2.webp)

You will then be prompted to authorize and sign the transaction. Go ahead and click **Sign and Submit** to create the proxy relationship.

Once the transaction has been successfully submitted, you will receive some notifications confirming the transaction.

As previously mentioned, you can also create a proxy from the **Accounts** page. To do so, navigate to the **Accounts** page, and take the following steps:

1. Select the 3 vertical dots next to the primary account
2. Select **Add proxy**

![Select the Add proxy menu item from the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-3.webp)

!!! note
    If the account already has a proxy, **Manage proxies** will be displayed as an option instead of **Add proxy**.

A pop-up will appear and you will be able to enter in the required information, such as the proxied/primary account, the proxy account, and type of proxy in order to create a proxy account. First click **Add Proxy**.

![Add a proxy account from the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-4.webp)

Then take the following steps:

1. Select the account you would like to set as a proxy
2. Select the proxy type
3. Click **Submit** and sign the transaction

![Add the details of the proxy account, including the proxy account and type.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-5.webp)

In the next section, you will learn how to verify that your proxy account was set up successfully.

## Verifying your Proxy Account {: #verifying-your-proxy-account }

### Via the Moonbeam DApp {: #verify-via-the-moonbeam-dapp }

When connected to [the Moonbeam dApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam/proxy){target=\_blank} with your primary account, you can see a list of accounts with proxy control over your connected primary account in the **Your Proxies** section.

![Verify proxy created via apps.moonbeam.network](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-6.webp)

Alternatively, by connecting the proxy account to [the Moonbeam dApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam/proxy){target=\_blank}, you can see a list of accounts over which the connected account has proxy control in the **Proxied accounts to you** section.

![Verify proxy control accounts via apps.moonbeam.network](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-7.webp)

### Via Polkadot.js Apps {: #verify-via-polkadot-js-apps }

There are a couple of ways that you can verify your proxy account has been successfully set up. Either through the **Accounts** page or via the **Chain state** page.

To check your proxy accounts from the [**Chain state** page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/chainstate){target=\_blank}, you can take the following steps:

1. From the **selected state query** dropdown, select **proxy**
2. Choose the **proxies** extrinsic
3. Select your primary (proxied) account
4. Click on the **+** button to send the query

![Verify your proxy accounts via the Extrinsics page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-8.webp)

The result will appear on the page showing you information about all of your proxies, including the delegate/proxy account address, the proxy type, the delay period if one was specified, and the total bond amount for all of your proxies in Wei.

As previously mentioned, you can also check your proxy accounts from the **Accounts** page. To do so, you can navigate to the **Accounts** page and there should be a Proxy symbol next to the primary account. Hover over the icon and click on **Manage proxies** to review your proxies.

![Hover over the proxy icon to manage your proxies via the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-9.webp)

A pop-up will appear where you can view an overview of all of your proxy accounts.

![Review your proxy accounts.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-10.webp)

## Executing a Proxy Transaction {: #executing-a-proxy-transaction }

Now that you have created a proxy account and verified that it was successfully set up, you can execute a transaction using the proxy account on behalf of the primary account.

To execute a transaction, navigate back to the [**Extrinsics** page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} and take the following steps:

1. Select the proxy account to submit the transaction from the **using the select account** dropdown
2. From the **submit the following extrinsic** menu, select **proxy**
3. Choose the **proxy** extrinsic
4. Select the primary account from the **real** dropdown
5. Select the **balances** call
6. Choose the **transfer** extrinsic
7. In the **dest** field, enter the address you would like to send funds to
8. In the **value** field, enter the amount of funds to send in Wei. For this example, you can send 2 DEV tokens, which will be `2000000000000000000` in Wei
9. Click **Submit Transaction**

![Execute a proxy transaction from the Extrinsics page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-11.webp)

A pop-up will appear for you to authorize and sign the transaction. Enter your password for the proxy account and click **Sign and Submit**.

If the transaction successfully went through, you should see a couple of notifications pop-up and if you head over to the **Accounts** page, you'll see that the balance of your primary account has decreased. If you check the balance of the account where you sent the funds to, you'll notice the balance there has increased.

That's it! You've successfully executed a transaction using a proxy account on behalf of your primary account.

## Removing a Proxy Account {: #removing-a-proxy-account }

### Via the Moonbeam DApp {: #remove-via-the-moonbeam-dapp }

To remove a proxy account, connect your primary account to [the Moonbeam dApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam/proxy){target=\_blank} and press **Remove** next to the proxy account that you want to remove. Alternatively, you can remove all proxy accounts of the primary account with **Remove All Proxies**. In either case, you must confirm the transaction in your wallet. 

![Remove account via Apps.Moonbeam.Network](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-12.webp)

### Via Polkadot.js Apps {: #remove-via-polkadot-js-apps }

Similarly to adding a proxy account, there are a couple of ways that you can remove a proxy account, either from the **Extrinsics** page or the **Accounts** page. Regardless of which page you use, you can elect to remove a single proxy account or all proxies associated with your primary account.

To remove a proxy from the [**Extrinsics** page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/extrinsics){target=\_blank}, you can take the following steps:

1. From the **using the selected account** dropdown, select your primary account
2. Then select **proxy**
3. Choose **removeProxy** to remove a single proxy or **removeProxies** to remove all associated proxies
4. If removing a single proxy, enter the proxy account to remove in the **delegate** field
5. Select the **proxyType** to remove, in this case choose **Balances**
6. Optionally, select a delay period in block numbers
7. Click **Submit Transaction**

![Remove a proxy account from the Extrinsics page of Polkadot.js Apps](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-13.webp)

A pop-up will appear for you to authorize and sign the transaction. While either account can sign transactions generally, removing a proxy must be performed by the primary account. Enter your password and click **Sign and Submit**.

You can follow the steps in the [Verifying your Proxy Account](#verifying-your-proxy-account) section to check that the proxy or proxies have been removed.

As previously mentioned, you can also remove a proxy from the **Accounts** page. To do so, on the **Accounts** page, select the 3 vertical dots next to the primary account and select **Manage Proxies**.

![Click on the Manage Proxies button to review and manage your proxy accounts.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-14.webp)

A pop-up will appear showing an overview of your proxy accounts. To remove a single proxy you can select the **X** button next to the proxy to remove. The proxy will disappear from the list, then you will need to click **Submit**. Next you will be able to enter your password and submit the transaction. Or to remove all proxies you can click on **Clear all**, then you will automatically be prompted to enter your password and submit the transaction.

![Remove a proxy account from the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/proxies-15.webp)

Once the transaction has successfully been submitted, you can review your current proxies or if you removed all proxies you will notice the proxy icon is no longer being displayed next to the primary account.

And that's it! You've successfully created a proxy, reviewed all proxy accounts associated with your primary account, executed a proxy transaction, and removed a proxy account!

# Moonbeam Account Balances

## Introduction {: #introduction }

While Moonbeam strives to be compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, there are some important Moonbeam differences that developers should know and understand in terms of account balances.

One of the design goals of Moonbeam is to create an environment that is as close as possible to Ethereum, and to offer a set of Web3 RPC endpoints that are compatible with Ethereum. However, Moonbeam is also a Substrate based chain, which means that it exposes Substrate RPCs, and that it has integral functionality that is powered by Substrate such as Staking, Governance, and other features which are not part of the Ethereum API.

Moonbeam [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} are one way that Moonbeam achieves Ethereum compatibility, by changing the underlying account type in the protocol to be Ethereum-like (H160 or 20 byte addresses starting with `0x`). Unified accounts are used by both the Substrate and Ethereum APIs, and map to the same underlying data storage on the blockchain. Nevertheless, there are important differences that users coming from Ethereum should understand when using Moonbeam accounts via the Ethereum API.

This guide will outline some of these main differences and what to expect when using Moonbeam for the first time.

## Ethereum Account Balances {: #ethereum-account-balances }

An account on Ethereum is an entity with a token balance (Ether or ETH in this case). Account-holders can send Ether transactions on Ethereum and accounts can be controlled by either users (with the private key for signing) or smart contracts.

Therefore, Ethereum has two main types of accounts: user-owned and contract-owned. No matter the type, an Ethereum account has a single balance field that represents the number of Wei owned by this address, where Wei is a denomination of ETH (1 x 10^18 Wei per ETH).

![Ethereum balances diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/balances/balances-1.webp)

## Moonbeam Account Balances {: #moonbeam-account-balances }

An account on Moonbeam is also an entity with a token balance (the token will depend on the network). Like on Ethereum, account holders can send token transactions on the Moonbeam Network they are connected to. In addition, accounts can be controlled by users (with the private key for signing) or smart contracts.

As with Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: user-owned and contract owned. However, on Moonbeam, within both account types, there are also [proxy accounts](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-proxies/){target=\_blank}, which can perform a limited number of actions on behalf of another account. In terms of balances, all of Moonbeam account types have five (5) different [balance types](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-accounts/#balance-types#balance-types){target=\_blank}:

 - **Free** — refers to the balance that can be used (not locked/frozen) from the Substrate API. The concept of `free` balance depends on the action to be executed. For example, voting in democracy will not subtract the allocated balance to the vote from `free` balance, but token holders won't be able to transfer that balance
 - **Reducible** — refers to the balance that can be used (not locked/frozen) through the Ethereum API on Moonbeam. For example, this is the balance displayed by MetaMask. It is the real spendable balance, accounting for all democracy locks (displayed as transferable in Polkadot.js Apps)
 - **Reserved** — refers to the balance held due to on-chain requirements, and that can be freed by performing some on-chain action.  For example, bonds for creating a proxy account or setting an on-chain identity are shown as `reserved balance`. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed
 - **Misc frozen** — represents a balance that the `free` balance may not drop below when withdrawing funds, except for transaction fee payment. For example, funds being used to vote on a governance proposal are shown as `misc frozen`. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed
 - **Fee frozen** — represents a balance that the `free` balance may not drop below when specifically paying for transaction fees. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed

![Moonbeam balances diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/balances/balances-2.webp)

### Calculating Your Transferable Balance {: #calculating-your-transferable-balance }

An account's transferable or spendable balance can be calculated as the free balance minus the maximum of `0` or the difference between frozen and reserved tokens: 

```text
Transferable = free - max(0, frozen - reserved )
```

Here are two examples of calculating transferable balances:

An account has `1000` free tokens, `200` frozen tokens, and `50` reserved tokens. The transferable balance is calculated as:

```text
Transferable = 1000 - max(0, 200 - 50) = 1000 - 150 = 850
```

If the frozen tokens are less than the reserved tokens, with `1000` free tokens, `100` frozen tokens, and `150` reserved tokens, the transferable balance would be:

```text
Transferable = 1000 - max(0, 100 - 150) = 1000 - 0 = 1000
```

### Retrieve Your Balance {: #retrieve-your-balance }

You can check on your balances, including your free (or transferable) and reserved balances (if exists), using the [Polkadot.js API](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}.

!!! note
    To test out the examples in this guide on Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network');

const main = async () => {
  const polkadotApi = await ApiPromise.create({
    provider: wsProvider,
  });

  const balances = await polkadotApi.query.system.account('INSERT_ADDRESS');
  console.log(balances.toHuman());
};

main();
```

You can also retrieve your balance locks using the Polkadot.js API.

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network');

const main = async () => {
  const polkadotApi = await ApiPromise.create({
    provider: wsProvider,
  });

  const locks = await polkadotApi.query.balances.locks('INSERT_ADDRESS');
  console.log(locks.toHuman());
};

main();
```

## Main Differences {: #main-differences }

The main difference between account balances on Ethereum and Moonbeam lies in the concept of locked and reserved balance on Moonbeam. These are tokens that are still owned by that account, but they are not spendable (yet).

From the Ethereum's API perspective, an account might show that it has a certain balance (called `reducible` balance). However, after an on-chain action, this value might increase (or decrease) without an actual balance transfer.

It is important to note that the account and behavior differences described here apply to account balances with the base asset (GLMR, MOVR) only and the balances of that asset that aren't interacting with smart contracts. As soon as a Moonbeam account balance is interacting with smart contracts, the behavior will be the same as Ethereum behavior. For example, if you wrap MOVR on Moonriver there is no way for the underlying balance to change via staking or governance actions, because that is part of the storage of the contract. In this case the reducible balance of that account has been committed to the wrapped MOVR smart contract and can't be modified by Substrate actions.

# Moonbeam Consensus & Finality

## Introduction {: #introduction }

While Moonbeam strives to be compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, there are some important Moonbeam differences that developers should know and understand in terms of consensus and finality.

In short, consensus is a way for different parties to agree on a shared state. As blocks are created, nodes in the network must decide which block will represent the next valid state. Finality defines when that valid state cannot be altered or reversed.

Ethereum began by using a consensus protocol based on [Proof-of-Work (PoW)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow){target=\_blank}, which provides probabilistic finality. However, in 2022, Ethereum switched to [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos){target=\_blank}, which provides deterministic finality, and no longer uses PoW. In contrast, Moonbeam uses a hybrid consensus protocol based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), which also provides deterministic finality. DPoS is an evolution of Polkadot's [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/){target=\_blank} concept, that puts more power into the hands of token holders by allowing delegators to choose which collator candidate they want to support and in what magnitude.

This guide will outline some of these main differences around consensus and finality, and what to expect when using Moonbeam for the first time.

## Ethereum Consensus and Finality {: #ethereum-consensus-and-finality }

Ethereum currently uses a PoS consensus protocol, in which validators stake ETH in the network and are responsible for producing blocks and checking the validity of new blocks. The timing of block production is fixed and is divided into 12 second slots and 32 slot epochs. One validator per slot is randomly selected to produce a block and broadcast it to the network. There is a randomly selected committee of validators per slot that is responsible for determining the validity of the block. The greater the stake in the network, the greater the chance the validator will be chosen to produce or validate a block.

Finality is deterministic in Ethereum's PoS consensus protocol and is achieved through "checkpoint" blocks. Validators agree on the state of a block at particular checkpoint blocks, which are always the first block in an epoch, and if two-thirds of the validators agree, the block is finalized. Block finality can be reverted; however, there are strong economic incentives in place so validators do not attempt to collude to revert a block. You can find out more information in Vitalik's [On Settlement Finality](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/05/09/on-settlement-finality){target=\_blank} blog, under the Finality in Casper section.

## Moonbeam Consensus and Finality {: #moonbeam-consensus-and-finality }

In Polkadot, there are collators and validators. [Collators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-collator/){target=\_blank} maintain parachains (in this case, Moonbeam) by collecting transactions from users and producing state transition proofs for the relay chain [validators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-validator/){target=\_blank}. The collator set (nodes that produce blocks) is selected based on the [stake they have in the network](/learn/features/consensus/){target=\_blank}.

For finality, Polkadot and Kusama rely on [GRANDPA](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#finality-gadget-grandpa){target=\_blank}. GRANDPA provides deterministic finality for any given transaction (block). In other words, when a block or transaction is marked as final, it can't be reverted except via on-chain governance or forking. Moonbeam follows this deterministic finality.

## Main Differences Between PoS and DPoS {: #main-differences }

In terms of consensus, Moonbeam is based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake, while Ethereum relies on a standard Proof-of-Stake system, which is slightly different. Although both mechanisms rely on the use of stake to validate and create new blocks, there are some key differences.

With PoS on Ethereum, validators are selected to produce and validate blocks based on their own stake in the network. As long as a validator has placed a validator deposit, they can be selected to produce and validate blocks. However, as previously mentioned, the greater the stake in the network, the higher the chances a validator has to be selected to produce and validate blocks.

On the other hand, with DPoS on Moonbeam, collators become eligible to produce blocks based on their own stake plus their delegated stake in the network. Any token holder can choose to delegate their stake to a collator candidate. The top collator candidates by stake, including delegations, join the active set. The number of candidates in the active set is subject to [governance](/learn/features/governance/){target=\_blank}. Once in the active set, collators are randomly selected to produce blocks using the [Nimbus Consensus Framework](/learn/features/consensus/){target=\_blank}. It is important to note that once a collator is in the active set, their total stake does not impact their chances of being selected to produce blocks.

In terms of finality, blocks on Ethereum can take quite a bit longer to finalize than on Moonbeam due to the checkpoint finality system it uses. In Ethereum, validators determine finality at checkpoint blocks, which are always the first block in an epoch. Since an epoch has 32 slots and each slot is 12 seconds, it'll take at least 384 seconds, or 6.4 minutes for a block to be finalized.

Moonbeam does not use checkpoint blocks and instead relies on Polkadot's GRANDPA finality gadget, where the finality process is completed in parallel to block production. In addition, the finality process incorporates the blockchain's structure, which allows the relay chain validators to vote on the highest block that they think is valid. In this scenario, the vote would apply to all of the blocks leading up to the one that is finalized, which speeds up the finalization process. After a block has been included in the relay chain, a block can be finalized within one block on Moonbeam.

## Check Transaction Finality with Ethereum RPC Endpoints {: #check-tx-finality-with-ethereum-rpc-endpoints }

Although the finality gadgets differ, you can use the same, fairly simple strategy to check for transaction finality on both Ethereum and Moonbeam:

 1. You ask the network for the hash of the latest finalized block
 2. You retrieve the block number using the hash
 3. You compare it with the block number of your transaction. If your transaction was included in a previous block, it is finalized
 4. As a safety check, retrieve the block by number and verify that the given transaction hash is in the block

The snippets below follow this strategy to check transaction finality. It uses the `finalized` option for the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block){target=\_blank} to get the latest finalized block.

To test out the examples in this guide on Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.

        print("Your transaction has not been included in the canonical chain")
    ```

## Check Transaction Finality with Moonbeam RPC Endpoints {: #check-tx-finality-with-moonbeam-rpc-endpoints }

Moonbeam has added support for two custom RPC endpoints, `moon_isBlockFinalized` and `moon_isTxFinalized`, that can be used to check whether an on-chain event is finalized. These methods are a bit more straightforward, as you don't need to compare block numbers to ensure your transaction is finalized.

For more information, you can go to the [Finality RPC Endpoints](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/moonbeam-custom-api/#rpc-methods){target=\_blank} section of the Moonbeam Custom API page.

You can modify the scripts from the Ethereum RPC section above to use `moon_isBlockFinalized` and `moon_isTxFinalized`. To do this, you can make custom calls to the Substrate JSON-RPC using the `send` method of both [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io){target=\_blank} and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6){target=\_blank}. Custom RPC requests are also possible using [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io){target=\_blank} with the `make_request` method. You'll need to pass in the method name and the parameters to the custom request, which you can find on the [Moonbeam Custom API](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/moonbeam-custom-api/){target=\_blank} page.

## Check Transaction Finality with Substrate RPC Endpoints {: #check-tx-finality-with-substrate-rpc-endpoints }

Using the following three RPC requests from the Substrate JSON-RPC, you can fetch the current finalized block and compare it with the block number of the transaction you want to check finality for:

- `chain_getFinalizedHead` - the first request gets the block hash of the last finalized block
- `chain_getHeader` - the second request gets the block header for a given block hash
- `eth_getTransactionReceipt` - this retrieves the transaction receipt given the transaction hash

The [Polkadot.js API package](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank} and [Python Substrate Interface package](/builders/substrate/libraries/py-substrate-interface/){target=\_blank} provide developers with a way to interact with Substrate chains using JavaScript and Python.

You can find more information about Polkadot.js and the Substrate JSON-RPC in the [official Polkadot.js documentation site](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc){target=\_blank}, and more about Python Substrate Interface in the [official PySubstrate documentation site](https://jamdottech.github.io/py-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank}.

# Security Considerations

## Introduction {: #introduction }

When developing smart contracts on Moonbeam, there are some security considerations to be aware of that do not apply when developing on Ethereum. Moonbeam has several [precompiled contracts](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/){target=\_blank}, which are Solidity interfaces that enable developers to access Substrate-based functionality through the Ethereum API, but circumventing the EVM. Although the precompiled contracts are designed to improve the developer experience, there can be some unintended consequences that must be considered.

This guide will outline and provide examples of some security considerations to be cognizant of when developing on Moonbeam.

## Arbitrary Code Execution {: #arbitrary-code-execution }

Arbitrary code execution in Solidity is the ability to execute code and call functions of other contracts using an arbitrary number of arguments of any type.

A smart contract allows arbitrary execution of another contract when it allows a user to influence its own `call()` and pass in arbitrary call data and/or the `call()`s target. The [`call()` function](https://solidity-by-example.org/call){target=\_blank} is made available through the [address data type in Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#address){target=\_blank}. When the `call()` function is invoked, the target contract is called using the arbitrary call data.

Arbitrary code execution follows the pattern in the diagram below when **Contract A** allows a user to influence its call to **Contract B**.

![Arbitrary code execution](/images/learn/core-concepts/security/security-1.webp)

As previously mentioned, one major concern of arbitrarily executing code on Moonbeam is that Moonbeam has precompile contracts that can be called, which can be used to get around some protections that are typically available on Ethereum. To safely use arbitrary code execution on Moonbeam, you should consider the following, which **only applies to contracts that allow arbitrary code execution**:

- Moonbeam [precompiled contracts](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/){target=\_blank} such as the Native ERC-20 precompile, XC-20 precompiles, and XCM-related precompiles allow users to manage and transfer assets without requiring access to the EVM. Instead, these actions are done using native Substrate code. So, if your contract holds native tokens or XC-20s and allows arbitrary code execution, these precompiles can be used to drain the balance of the contract, bypassing any security checks that are normally enforced by the EVM
- Setting the value attribute of the transaction object to a fixed amount when using the `call()` function (for example, `call{value: 0}(...)`) can be bypassed by calling the native asset precompile and specifying an amount to transfer in the encoded call data
- Allowing users that consume your contract to pass in arbitrary call data that will execute any function on the target contract, especially if the contract being targeted is a precompile, is **not** safe. To be safe, you can hard code the function selector for a safe function that you want to allow to be executed
- Blacklisting target contracts (including precompiles) in the function that executes arbitrary call data is **not** considered safe, as other precompiles might be added in the future. Providing whitelisted target contracts in the function that executes the arbitrary call data is considered safe, assuming that the contracts being called are not precompiles, or that in the case they are, the contract making the call does not hold the native token or any XC-20

In the following sections, you'll learn about each of these security considerations through examples.

### Precompiles Can Override a Set Value {: #setting-a-value }

On Ethereum, a smart contract that allows for arbitrary code execution could force the value of a call to be a specific amount (for example, `{value: 0}`), guaranteeing that only that amount of native currency would be sent with the transaction. Whereas on Moonbeam, the [native ERC-20 precompile contract](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/erc20/){target=\_blank} enables you to interact with the native currency on Moonbeam as an ERC-20 through the Substrate API. As a result, you can transfer the Moonbeam native asset from a smart contract by setting the `value` of a call, as well as through the native ERC-20 precompile. If you set the `value` of an arbitrary call, it can be overridden by targeting the [native ERC-20 precompile contract](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/erc20/){target=\_blank} and passing in call data to transfer the native asset. Since ERC-20s and XC-20s are not native assets, setting the value attribute doesn't provide any protection for these types of assets on Ethereum or Moonbeam.

For example, if you have a contract that allows arbitrary code execution and you pass it encoded call data that transfers the balance of a contract to another address, you could essentially drain the given contract of its balance.

To get the encoded call data, you can use any of the [ABI encoding functions outlined in the Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions){target=\_blank}, including `abi.encodeWithSelector` as seen in the following function:

```solidity
function getBytes(address _erc20Contract, address _arbitraryCallContract, address _to) public view returns (bytes memory) {
    // Load ERC-20 interface of contract
    IERC20 erc20 = IERC20(_erc20Contract);
    // Get amount to transfer
    uint256 amount = erc20.balanceOf(_arbitraryCallContract);
    // Build the encoded call data
    return abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, _to, amount);
}
```

Once you have the encoded call data, you could make an arbitrary call to the [native ERC-20 precompile contract](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/erc20/){target=\_blank}, set the value of the call to `0`, and pass in the call data in bytes:

```solidity
function makeArbitraryCall(address _target, bytes calldata _bytes) public {
    // Value: 0 does not protect against native ERC-20 precompile calls or XCM precompiles
    (bool success,) = _target.call{value: 0}(_bytes);
    require(success);
}
```

The value of `0` will be overridden by the amount to be transferred as specified in the encoded call data, which in this example is the balance of the contract.

### Whitelisting Safe Function Selectors {: #whitelisting-function-selectors }

By whitelisting a specific function selector, you can control what functions can be executed and ensure only functions that are considered safe and do not call precompiles are allowed to be called.

To get the function selector to whitelist, you can [keccack256 hash](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html){target=\_blank} the signature of the function.

Once you have the whitelisted function selector, you can use inline assembly to get the function selector from the encoded call data and compare the two selectors using the [require function](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require){target=\_blank}. If the function selector from the encoded call data matches the whitelisted function selector, you can make the call. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

```solidity
function makeArbitraryCall(address _target, bytes calldata _bytes) public {
    // Get the function selector from the encoded call data
    bytes4 selector;
    assembly {
        selector := calldataload(_bytes.offset)
    }

    // Ensure the call data calls an approved and safe function
    require(selector == INSERT_WHITELISTED_FUNCTION_SELECTOR);

    // Arbitrary call
    (bool success,) = _target.call(_bytes);
    require(success);
}
```

### Whitelisting Safe Contracts {: #whitelisting-safe-contracts}

By whitelisting a specific target contract address in the function that can execute arbitrary call data, you can ensure that the call is considered safe, as the EVM will enforce that only whitelisted contracts can be called. This assumes that the contracts being called are not precompiles. If they are precompiles, you'll want to make sure that the contract making the call does not hold the native token or any XC-20.

Blacklisting contracts from arbitrary code execution is not considered safe, as other precompiles might be added in the future.

To whitelist a given contract, you can use the [require function](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require){target=\_blank}, which will compare the target contract address to the whitelisted contract address. If the addresses match, the call can be executed. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

```solidity
function makeArbitraryCall(address _target, bytes calldata _bytes) public {
    // Ensure the contract address is safe
    require(_target == INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);

    // Arbitrary call
    (bool success,) = _target.call(_bytes);
    require(success);
}
```

## Precompiles Can Bypass Sender vs Origin Checks {: #bypass-sender-origin-checks }

The transaction origin, or `tx.origin`, is the address of the externally owned account (EOA) the transaction originated from. Whereas the `msg.sender` is the address that has initiated the current call. The `msg.sender` can be an EOA or a contract. The two can be different values if one contract calls another contract, as opposed to directly calling a contract from an EOA. In this case, the `msg.sender` will be the calling contract and the `tx.origin` will be the EOA that initially called the calling contract.

For example, if Alice calls a function in contract A that then calls a function in contract B, when looking at the call to contract B, the `tx.origin` is Alice and the `msg.sender` is contract A.

!!! note
    As a [best practice](https://consensysdiligence.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/tx-origin/){target=\_blank}, `tx.origin` should not be used for authorization. Instead, you should use `msg.sender`.

You can use the [require function](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require){target=\_blank} to compare the `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`. If they are the same address, you're ensuring that only EOAs can call the function. If the `msg.sender` is a contract address, an exception will be thrown.

```solidity
function transferFunds(address payable _target) payable public {
    require(tx.origin == msg.sender);
    _target.call{value: msg.value};
}
```

On Ethereum, you can use this check to ensure that a given contract function can only be called once by an EOA. This is because on Ethereum, EOAs can only interact with a contract once per transaction. However, **this is not the case** on Moonbeam, as EOAs can interact with a contract multiple times at once by using precompiled contracts, such as the [batch](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/batch/){target=\_blank} and [call permit](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/call-permit/){target=\_blank} precompiles.

With the batch precompile, users can perform multiple calls to a contract atomically. The caller of the batch function will be the `msg.sender` and `tx.origin`, enabling multiple contract interactions at once.

With the call permit precompile, if a user wants to interact with a contract multiple times in one transaction, they can do so by signing a permit for each contract interaction and dispatching all of the permits in a single function call. This will only bypass the `tx.origin == msg.sender` check if the dispatcher is the same account as the permit signer. Otherwise, the `msg.sender` will be the permit signer and the `tx.origin` will be the dispatcher, causing an exception to be thrown.

# Balance Transfers on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

While Moonbeam strives to be compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, there are some important Moonbeam differences that developers should know and understand in terms of balance transfers of the base network token (for example, GLMR and MOVR).

Token holders have two ways of initiating a balance transfer on Moonbeam. On the one hand, users can use the Ethereum API via apps like MetaMask, MathWallet, or any other tools that use the Ethereum JSON-RPC. On the other hand, users can use the Substrate API via the Polkadot.js Apps website or directly using the Substrate RPC.

Developers need to be aware that token holders can leverage both APIs to transfer the base-layer network token. Note that these comments do not apply to transfers of other assets, like ERC-20 based assets in the Moonriver or Moonbeam EVMs. Transfers of these assets are only done via the Ethereum APIs since these are smart contract interactions.

This guide will outline some of the main differences between both APIs for base-layer network token balance transfers and what to expect when using Moonbeam for the first time.

## Ethereum Transfers {: #ethereum-transfers }

A simple balance transfer using the Ethereum API relies on the `eth_sendRawTransaction` JSON-RPC. This can be done directly from one account to another or via a smart contract.

There are different strategies to listen for transfers or balance changes on Ethereum, which are not covered in this documentation. But they are all focused on different strategies using the Ethereum JSON-RPC.

## Moonbeam Transfers {: #moonbeam-transfers }

As stated before, Moonbeam enables token holders to execute base-layer network token transfers via both the Ethereum and Substrate API. There are multiple scenarios to trigger token transfers on Moonbeam. Consequently, to monitor all transfers, **you should use the Polkadot.js SDK** (Substrate API).

Before going over the different scenarios, there are two different elements associated with a block:

 - **Extrinsic** — refers to state changes that originated outside of the system itself. The most common form of extrinsic is a transaction. They are ordered by execution
 - **Events** — refers to logs generated from the extrinsic. There can be multiple events per extrinsic. They are ordered by execution

The different transfer scenarios are:

 - **Substrate transfer** — it will create an extrinsic, either `balances.transferAllowDeath` or `balances.transferKeepAlive`. It will trigger **one** `balances.Transfer` event
 - **Substrate feature** — some native Substrate features can create extrinsic that would send tokens to an address. For example, [Treasury](/learn/features/treasury/){target=\_blank} can create an extrinsic such as `treasury.proposeSend`, which will trigger **one or multiple** `balances.Transfer` events
 - **Ethereum transfer** — it will create an `ethereum.transact` extrinsic with an empty input. It will trigger **one** `balances.Transfer` event
 - **Ethereum transfers via smart contracts** — it will create an `ethereum.transact` extrinsic with some data as input. It will trigger **one or multiple** `balances.Transfer` events

All the scenarios described above will effectively transfer base-layer network tokens. The easiest way to monitor them all is to rely on the `balances.Transfer` event.

## Monitor Native Token Balance Transfers {: #monitor-transfers }

The following code samples will demonstrate how to listen to both types of native token transfers, sent via the Substrate or Ethereum API, using either the [Polkadot.js API library](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/){target=\_blank} or [Substrate API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar){target=\_blank}. The following code snippets are for demo purposes only and should not be used without modification and further testing in a production environment.

### Using Polkadot.js API {: #using-polkadotjs-api }

The [Polkadot.js API package](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/){target=\_blank} provides developers a way to interact with Substrate chains using JavaScript.

The following code snippet uses [`subscribeFinalizedHeads`](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc/#subscribefinalizedheads-header){target=\_blank} to subscribe to new finalized block headers, loops through extrinsics fetched from the block, and retrieves the events of each extrinsic. Then, it checks if any event corresponds to a `balances.Transfer` event. If so, it will extract the `from`, `to`, `amount`, and the `tx hash` of the transfer and display it on the console. Note that the `amount` is shown in the smallest unit (Wei).  You can find all the available information about Polkadot.js and the Substrate JSON-RPC on their [official documentation site](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc){target=\_blank}.

```ts
import { typesBundlePre900 } from 'moonbeam-types-bundle';
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

// This script will listen to all GLMR transfers (Substrate & Ethereum) and extract the tx hash
// It can be adapted for Moonriver or Moonbase Alpha

const main = async () => {
  // Define the provider for Moonbeam
  const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network');
  // Create the provider using Moonbeam types
  const polkadotApi = await ApiPromise.create({
    provider: wsProvider,
    typesBundle: typesBundlePre900 as any,
  });

  // Subscribe to finalized blocks
  await polkadotApi.rpc.chain.subscribeFinalizedHeads(
    async (lastFinalizedHeader) => {
      const [{ block }, records] = await Promise.all([
        polkadotApi.rpc.chain.getBlock(lastFinalizedHeader.hash),
        polkadotApi.query.system.events.at(lastFinalizedHeader.hash),
      ]);

      block.extrinsics.forEach((extrinsic, index) => {
        const {
          method: { args, method, section },
        } = extrinsic;

        const isEthereum = section == 'ethereum' && method == 'transact';

        // Gets the transaction object
        const tx = args[0] as any;

        // Convert to the correct Ethereum Transaction format
        const ethereumTx =
          isEthereum &&
          ((tx.isLegacy && tx.asLegacy) ||
            (tx.isEip1559 && tx.asEip1559) ||
            (tx.isEip2930 && tx.asEip2930));

        // Check if the transaction is a transfer
        const isEthereumTransfer =
          ethereumTx &&
          ethereumTx.input.length === 0 &&
          ethereumTx.action.isCall;

        // Retrieve all events for this extrinsic
        const events = records.filter(
          ({ phase }) =>
            phase.isApplyExtrinsic && phase.asApplyExtrinsic.eq(index)
        );

        // This hash will only exist if the transaction was executed through Ethereum.
        let ethereumHash = '';

        if (isEthereum) {
          // Search for Ethereum execution
          events.forEach(({ event }) => {
            if (event.section == 'ethereum' && event.method == 'Executed') {
              ethereumHash = event.data[2].toString();
            }
          });
        }

        // Search if it is a transfer
        events.forEach(({ event }) => {
          if (event.section == 'balances' && event.method == 'Transfer') {
            const from = event.data[0].toString();
            const to = event.data[1].toString();
            const balance = (event.data[2] as any).toBigInt();

            const substrateHash = extrinsic.hash.toString();

            console.log(
              `Transfer from ${from} to ${to} of ${balance} (block #${lastFinalizedHeader.number})`
            );
            console.log(`  - Triggered by extrinsic: ${substrateHash}`);
            if (isEthereum) {
              console.log(
                `  - Ethereum (isTransfer: ${isEthereumTransfer}) hash: ${ethereumHash}`
              );
            }
          }
        });
      });
    }
  );
};

main();
```

### Using Substrate API Sidecar {: #using-substrate-api-sidecar }

Developers can also retrieve Moonbeam blocks and monitor transactions sent via both the Substrate and Ethereum APIs using [Substrate API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar){target=\_blank}, a REST API service for interacting with blockchains built with the Substrate framework.

The following code snippet uses the Axios HTTP client to query the [Sidecar endpoint `/blocks/head`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist){target=\_blank} for the latest finalized block and then decodes the block for the `from`, `to`, `value`, `tx hash`, and `transaction status` of native token transfers at both the EVM and Substrate API level.

```js
import axios from 'axios';

// This script will decode all native token transfers (Substrate & Ethereum) in a given Sidecar block, and extract the tx hash. It can be adapted for any Moonbeam network.

// Endpoint to retrieve the latest block
const endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/blocks/head';

async function main() {
  try {
    // Retrieve the block from the Sidecar endpoint
    const response = await axios.get(endpoint);
    // Retrieve the block height of the current block
    console.log('Block Height: ' + response.data.number);

    // Iterate through all extrinsics in the block
    response.data.extrinsics.forEach((extrinsic) => {
      // Retrieve Ethereum Transfers
      if (
        extrinsic.method.pallet === 'ethereum' &&
        extrinsic.method.method === 'transact'
      ) {
        // Get the value for any of the three EIP transaction standards supported
        const value =
          (extrinsic.args.transaction.legacy &&
            extrinsic.args.transaction.legacy.value) ||
          (extrinsic.args.transaction.eip1559 &&
            extrinsic.args.transaction.eip1559.value) ||
          (extrinsic.args.transaction.eip2930 &&
            extrinsic.args.transaction.eip2930.value);

        // Iterate through the events to get transaction details
        extrinsic.events.forEach((event) => {
          if (
            event.method.pallet === 'ethereum' &&
            event.method.method === 'Executed'
          ) {
            console.log('From: ' + event.data[0]);
            console.log('To: ' + event.data[1]);
            console.log('Tx Hash: ' + event.data[2]);
            console.log('Value: ' + value);
            // Check the execution status
            if (event.data[3].succeed) {
              console.log('Status: Success');
            } else {
              console.log('Status: Failed');
            }
          }
        });
      }

      // Retrieve Substrate Transfers
      if (
        extrinsic.method.pallet === 'balances' &&
        (extrinsic.method.method === 'transferKeepAlive' ||
          extrinsic.method.method === 'transferAllowDeath')
      ) {
        // Iterate through the events to get transaction details
        extrinsic.events.forEach((event) => {
          if (
            event.method.pallet === 'balances' &&
            event.method.method === 'Transfer'
          ) {
            console.log('From: ' + event.data[0]);
            console.log('To: ' + event.data[1]);
            console.log('Tx Hash: ' + extrinsic.hash);
            console.log('Value: ' + event.data[2]);
            // Check the execution status
            if (extrinsic.success) {
              console.log('Status: Success');
            } else {
              console.log('Status: Failed');
            }
          }
        });
      }
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

main();
```

# Calculating Transaction Fees on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Similar to [the Ethereum and Substrate APIs for sending transfers](/learn/core-concepts/transfers-api/){target=\_blank} on Moonbeam, the Substrate and EVM layers on Moonbeam also have distinct transaction fee models that developers should be aware of when they need to calculate and keep track of transaction fees for their transactions.

For starters, Ethereum transactions consume gas units based on their computational complexity and data storage requirements. On the other hand, Substrate transactions use the concept of "weight" to determine fees. In this guide, you'll learn how to calculate the transaction fees for both Substrate and Ethereum transactions. In terms of Ethereum transactions, you'll also learn about the key differences between how transaction fees are calculated on Moonbeam and Ethereum.

### Key Differences with Ethereum {: #key-differences-with-ethereum}

There are some key differences between the transaction fee model on Moonbeam and the one on Ethereum that developers should be mindful of when developing on Moonbeam:

  - The [dynamic fee mechanism](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-status-idea-dynamic-fee-mechanism-for-moonbeam-and-moonriver/241){target=\_blank} resembles that of [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank} but the implementation is different

  - The amount of gas used in Moonbeam's transaction fee model is mapped from the transaction's Substrate extrinsic `refTime` component of the transaction weight via a fixed factor of `{{ networks.moonbase.tx_weight_to_gas_ratio }}` and `proofSize` component of the transaction weight via a fixed factor of `{{ xcm.generic_weights.proof_size.weight_per_gas }}`. The transaction weight vector is then multiplied with the unit gas price to calculate the transaction fee. This fee model means it can potentially be significantly cheaper to send transactions such as basic balance transfers via the Ethereum API than the Substrate API.

  - The EVM is designed to solely have capacity for gas and Moonbeam requires additional metrics outside of gas. In particular, Moonbeam needs the ability to record proof size, which is the amount of storage required on Moonbeam for a relay chain validator to verify a state transition. When the capacity limit for proof size has been reached for the current block, which is 25% of the block limit, an "Out of Gas" error will be thrown. This can happen even if there is remaining *legacy* gas in the gasometer. This additional metric also impacts refunds. Refunds are based on the more consumed resource after the execution. In other words, if more proof size has been consumed proportionally than legacy gas, the refund will be calculated using proof size

  - Moonbeam has implemented a new mechanism defined in [MBIP-5](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/master/MBIPS/MBIP-5.md){target=\_blank} that limits block storage and increases gas usage for transactions that result in an increase in storage

## Overview of MBIP-5 {: #overview-of-mbip-5 }

MBIP-5 introduced changes to Moonbeam's fee mechanism that account for storage growth on the network, which deviates from the way Ethereum handles fees. By raising the gas needed to execute transactions that increase chain state and by establishing a block storage limit, it controls storage growth.

This impacts contract deployments that add to the chain state, transactions that create new storage entries, and precompiled contract calls that result in the creation of new accounts.

The block storage limit prevents transactions in a single block from collectively increasing the storage state by more than the limit. The limit for each network is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }}KB
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }}KB
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }}KB
    ```

To determine the amount of gas for storage in bytes, there is a ratio that is defined as:

```text
Ratio = Block Gas Limit / (Block Storage Limit * 1024 Bytes)
```

The block gas limit for each network is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.gas_block }}
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.gas_block }}
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.gas_block }}
    ```

Knowing the block gas and storage limits, the ratio of gas to storage is computed as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonbeam.gas_block_numbers_only }} / ({{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }} * 1024)
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }} 
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonriver.gas_block_numbers_only }} / ({{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }} * 1024)
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }} 
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonbase.gas_block_numbers_only }} / ({{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }} * 1024)
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }} 
    ```

Then, you can take the storage growth in bytes for a given transaction and multiply it by the gas-to-storage growth ratio to determine how many units of gas to add to the transaction. For example, if you execute a transaction that increases the storage by {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.example_storage }} bytes, the following calculation is used to determine the units of gas to add:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.example_storage }} * {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }}
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.example_addtl_gas }}
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.example_storage }} * {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }}
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.example_addtl_gas }}
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.example_storage }} * {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }}
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.example_addtl_gas }}
    ```

To see how this MBIP differentiates Moonbeam from Ethereum firsthand, you can estimate the gas for two different contract interactions on both networks: one that modifies an item in the chain state and one that doesn't. For example, you can use a greeting contract that allows you to store a name and then use the name to say "Hello".

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SayHello {
    mapping(address => string) public addressToName;

    constructor(string memory _name) {
        addressToName[msg.sender] = _name;
    }

    // Store a name associated to the address of the sender
    function setName(string memory _name) public {
        addressToName[msg.sender] = _name;
    } 

    // Use the name in storage associated to the sender
    function sayHello() external view returns (string memory) {
        return string(abi.encodePacked("Hello ", addressToName[msg.sender]));
    }
}
```

You can deploy this contract on both Moonriver and Ethereum, or on Moonbeam's TestNet, Moonbase Alpha, and Ethereum's TestNet, Sepolia. The above contract has already been deployed to Moonbase Alpha and Sepolia. You can feel free to access these contracts at the following addresses:

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    0xDFF8E772A9B212dc4FbA19fa650B440C5c7fd7fd
    ```

=== "Sepolia"

    ```text
    0x8D0C059d191011E90b963156569A8299d7fE777d
    ```

Next, you can use the `eth_estimateGas` method to check the gas estimate for calling the `setName` and `sayHello` functions on each network. To do so, you'll need the bytecode for each transaction, which includes the function selector, and for the `setName` function, the name to be set. This example bytecode sets the name to "Chloe":

=== "Set Name"

    ```text
    0xc47f00270000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000543686c6f65000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    ```

=== "Say Hello"

    ```text
    0xef5fb05b
    ```

Now, you can use the following curl commands on Moonbase Alpha to return the gas estimate:

=== "Set Name"

    ```sh
    curl {{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }} -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
    '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "eth_estimateGas",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0xDFF8E772A9B212dc4FbA19fa650B440C5c7fd7fd",
            "data": "0xc47f00270000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000543686c6f65000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        }]
    }'
    ```

=== "Say Hello"

    ```sh
    curl {{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }} -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
    '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "eth_estimateGas",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0xDFF8E772A9B212dc4FbA19fa650B440C5c7fd7fd",
            "data": "0xef5fb05b"
        }]
    }'
    ```

Then on Sepolia, you can use the same bytecode for the `data` and modify the RPC URL and contract address to target the contract deployed to Sepolia:

=== "Set Name"

    ```sh
    curl https://sepolia.publicgoods.network -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
    '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "eth_estimateGas",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0x8D0C059d191011E90b963156569A8299d7fE777d",
            "data": "0xc47f00270000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000543686c6f65000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        }]
    }'
    ```

=== "Say Hello"

    ```sh
    curl https://sepolia.publicgoods.network -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
    '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "eth_estimateGas",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0x8D0C059d191011E90b963156569A8299d7fE777d",
            "data": "0xef5fb05b"
        }]
    }'
    ```

At the time of writing, the gas estimates for both networks are as follows:

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    |   Method   | Gas Estimate |
    |:----------:|:------------:|
    |  `setName` |     45977    |
    | `sayHello` |     25938    |

=== "Sepolia"

    |   Method   | Gas Estimate |
    |:----------:|:------------:|
    |  `setName` |     21520    |
    | `sayHello` |     21064    |

You'll see that on Sepolia, the gas estimates for both calls are very similar, whereas on Moonbase Alpha, there is a noticeable difference between the calls and that the `setName` call, which modifies the storage, uses more gas than the `sayHello` call.

## Ethereum API Transaction Fees {: #ethereum-api-transaction-fees }

To calculate the fee incurred on a Moonbeam transaction sent via the Ethereum API, the following formula can be used:

=== "EIP-1559"

    ```text
    GasPrice = BaseFee + MaxPriorityFeePerGas < MaxFeePerGas ? 
                BaseFee + MaxPriorityFeePerGas : 
                MaxFeePerGas;
    Transaction Fee = (GasPrice * TransactionWeight) / {{ networks.moonbase.tx_weight_to_gas_ratio }}
    ```

=== "Legacy"

    ```text
    Transaction Fee = (GasPrice * TransactionWeight) / {{ networks.moonbase.tx_weight_to_gas_ratio }}
    ```

=== "EIP-2930"

    ```text
    Transaction Fee = (GasPrice * TransactionWeight) / {{ networks.moonbase.tx_weight_to_gas_ratio }}
    ```

!!! note
    EIP-1559 transaction fees on Moonbeam are calculated using the previous block's base fee.

The following sections describe in more detail each of the components needed to calculate the transaction fee.

### Base Fee {: #base-fee}

The `BaseFee` is the minimum amount charged to send a transaction and is a value set by the network itself. It was introduced in [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank}. Moonbeam has its own [dynamic fee mechanism](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-status-idea-dynamic-fee-mechanism-for-moonbeam-and-moonriver/241){target=\_blank} for calculating the base fee, which is adjusted based on block congestion. As of runtime 2300, the dynamic fee mechanism has been rolled out to all of the Moonbeam-based networks.

The minimum gas price for each network is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    |     Variable      |                   Value                    |
    |:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
    | Minimum Gas Price | {{ networks.moonbeam.min_gas_price }} Gwei |

=== "Moonriver"

    |     Variable      |                   Value                    |
    |:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
    | Minimum Gas Price | {{ networks.moonriver.min_gas_price }} Gwei |

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    |     Variable      |                   Value                    |
    |:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
    | Minimum Gas Price | {{ networks.moonbase.min_gas_price }} Gwei |

To calculate the dynamic base fee, the following calculation is used:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    BaseFee = NextFeeMultiplier * 31250000000 / 10^18
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    BaseFee = NextFeeMultiplier * 312500000 / 10^18
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    BaseFee = NextFeeMultiplier * 31250000 / 10^18
    ```

The value of `NextFeeMultiplier` can be retrieved from the Substrate Sidecar API, via the following endpoint:

```text
GET /pallets/transaction-payment/storage/nextFeeMultiplier?at={blockId}
```

The pallets endpoints for Sidecar returns data relevant to a pallet, such as data in a pallet's storage. You can read more about the pallets endpoint in the [official Sidecar documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist/#operations-tag-pallets){target=\_blank}. The data at hand that's required from storage is the `nextFeeMultiplier`, which can be found in the `transaction-payment` pallet. The stored `nextFeeMultiplier` value can be read directly from the Sidecar storage schema. Read as a JSON object, the relevant nesting structure is as follows:

```text
RESPONSE JSON Storage Object:
    |--at
        |--hash
        |--height
    |--pallet
    |--palletIndex
    |--storageItem
    |--keys
    |--value
```

The relevant data will be stored in the `value` key of the JSON object. This value is a fixed point data type, hence the real value is found by dividing the `value` by `10^18`. This is why [the calculation of `BaseFee`](#ethereum-api-transaction-fees) includes such an operation.

### GasPrice, MaxFeePerGas, and MaxPriorityFeePerGas {: #gasprice-maxfeepergas-maxpriorityfeepergas }

The `GasPrice` is used to specify the gas price of legacy transactions prior to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank}. The `MaxFeePerGas` and `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` were both introduced in EIP-1559 alongside the `BaseFee`. The `MaxFeePerGas` defines the maximum fee permitted to be paid per unit of gas and is the sum of the `BaseFee` and the `MaxPriorityFeePerGas`. The `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` is the maximum priority fee configured by the sender of a transaction that is used to incentivize the prioritization of a transaction in a block.

Although Moonbeam is Ethereum-compatible, it is also a Substrate-based chain at its core, and priorities work differently in Substrate than in Ethereum. In Substrate, transactions are not prioritized by gas price. To address this, Moonbeam uses a modified prioritization system that reprioritizes Substrate transactions using an Ethereum-first solution. A Substrate transaction still goes through the validity process, where it is assigned transaction tags, longevity, and a priority. The original priority is then overwritten with a new priority based on the transaction's fee per gas, which is derived from the transaction's tip and weight. If the transaction is an Ethereum transaction, the priority is set according to the priority fee.

It's important to note that priority is not the sole component responsible for determining the order of transactions in a block. Other components, such as the longevity of a transaction, also play a role in the sorting process.

The values of `GasPrice`, `MaxFeePerGas` and `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` for the applicable transaction types can be read from the block JSON object according to the structure described in [the Sidecar API page](/builders/substrate/libraries/sidecar/#evm-fields-mapping-in-block-json-object){target=\_blank}.

The data for an Ethereum transaction in a particular block can be extracted from the following block endpoint:

```text
GET /blocks/{blockId}
```

The paths to the relevant values have also been truncated and reproduced below:

### Transaction Weight {: #transaction-weight}

`TransactionWeight` is a Substrate mechanism used to measure the execution time a given transaction takes to be executed within a block. A transaction's weight is a vector of two components: `refTime` and `proofSize`. `refTime` refers to the amount of computational time that can be used for execution. `proofSize` refers to the size of the PoV (Proof of Validity) of the Moonbeam block that gets submitted to the Polkadot Relay Chain for validation. Since both `refTime` and `proofSize` are integral components of determining a weight, it is impossible to obtain an accurate weight value with just one of these values.

For all transactions types, `TransactionWeight` can be retrieved under the event of the relevant extrinsic where the `method` field is set to:

```text
pallet: "system", method: "ExtrinsicSuccess" 
```

And then `TransactionWeight` is mapped to the following two fields of the block JSON object. `proofSize` is mapped as follows:

```text
extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[0].weight.proof_size 
```

And `refTime` is mapped as follows:

```text
extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[0].weight.ref_time 
```

### Fee History Endpoint {: #eth-feehistory-endpoint }

Moonbeam networks implement the [`eth_feeHistory`](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/ethereum/ethereum-api-endpoints/eth-fee-history){target_blank} JSON-RPC endpoint as a part of the support for EIP-1559.

`eth_feeHistory` returns a collection of historical gas information from which you can reference and calculate what to set for the `MaxFeePerGas` and `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` fields when submitting EIP-1559 transactions.

The following curl example will return the gas information of the last 10 blocks starting from the latest block on the respective Moonbeam network using `eth_feeHistory`:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```sh
    curl --location \
         --request POST '{{ networks.moonbeam.rpc_url }}' \
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         --data-raw '{
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 1,
            "method": "eth_feeHistory",
            "params": ["0xa", "latest"]
         }'
    ```

            "params": ["0xa", "latest"]
         }'
    ```

### Sample Code for Calculating Transaction Fees {: #sample-code }

The following code snippet uses the [Axios HTTP client](https://axios-http.com){target=\_blank} to query the [Sidecar endpoint `/blocks/head`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist/#operations-tag-blocks){target=\_blank} for the latest finalized block. It then calculates the transaction fees of all transactions in the block according to the transaction type (for Ethereum API: legacy, EIP-1559 or EIP-2930 standards, and for Substrate API), as well as calculating the total transaction fees in the block.

!!! note
    EIP-1559 transaction fees on Moonbeam are calculated using the previous block's base fee.

The following code sample is for demo purposes only and should not be used without modification and further testing in a production environment.

You can use the following snippet for any Moonbeam-based network, but you'll need to modify the `baseFee` accordingly. You can refer back to the [Base Fee](#base-fee) section to get the calculation for each network.

```js
import axios from 'axios';

// This script calculates the transaction fees of all transactions in a block
// according to the transaction type (for Ethereum API: legacy, EIP-1559 or
// EIP-2930 standards, and Substrate API) using the dynamic fee mechanism.
// It also calculates the total fees in the block

// Endpoint to retrieve the latest block
const endpointBlock = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/blocks/head';

## Substrate API Transaction Fees {: #substrate-api-transaction-fees }

This section of the guide assumes you are interacting with Moonbeam blocks via [the Substrate API Sidecar](/builders/substrate/libraries/sidecar/){target=\_blank} service. There are other ways of interacting with Moonbeam blocks, such as using [the Polkadot.js API library](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}. The logic is identical once the blocks are retrieved.

You can reference the [Substrate API Sidecar page](/builders/substrate/libraries/sidecar/){target=\_blank} for information on installing and running your own Sidecar service instance, as well as more details on how to decode Sidecar blocks for Moonbeam transactions.

**Note that the information in this section assumes you are running version {{ networks.moonbase.substrate_api_sidecar.stable_version }} of the Substrate Sidecar REST API.**

All the information around fee data for transactions sent via the Substrate API can be extracted from the following block endpoint:

```text
GET /blocks/{blockId}
```

The block endpoints will return data relevant to one or more blocks. You can read more about the block endpoints on the [official Sidecar documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist/#operations-tag-blocks){target=\_blank}. Read as a JSON object, the relevant nesting structure is as follows:  

```text
RESPONSE JSON Block Object:
    ...
    |--number
    |--extrinsics
        |--{extrinsic_number}
            |--method
            |--signature
            |--nonce
            |--args
            |--tip           
            |--hash
            |--info
            |--era
            |--events
                |--{event_number}
                    |--method
                        |--pallet: "transactionPayment"
                        |--method: "TransactionFeePaid"
                    |--data
                        |--0
                        |--1
                        |--2
    ...

```

The object mappings are summarized as follows:

|   Tx Information   |                      Block JSON Field                       |
|:------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
| Fee paying account | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[0]` |
|  Total fees paid   | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[1]` |
|        Tip         | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[2]` |

The transaction fee related information can be retrieved under the event of the relevant extrinsic where the `method` field is set to:

```text
pallet: "transactionPayment", method: "TransactionFeePaid" 
```

And then the total transaction fee paid for this extrinsic is mapped to the following field of the block JSON object:

```text
extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[1]
```

# Unified Accounts

## Introduction {: #introduction }

As Moonbeam is designed to be an Ethereum-compatible parachain on Polkadot, the underlying account system replaces the default Substrate-style accounts and keys with Ethereum-style accounts and keys. As a result, you can interact with your Moonbeam account using [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank} and Ethereum tools you may already be familiar with, such as [Remix](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} and [Hardhat](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/hardhat/){target=\_blank}.

You can also interact with your Moonbeam account using Polkadot.js Apps as it natively supports H160 addresses and ECDSA keys. For more information on this integration, you can check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam Using Polkadot.js Apps](/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Substrate EVM Compatible Blockchain {: #substrate-evm-compatible-blockchain }

Any parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem can offer a full EVM implementation, which provides the possibility of executing Solidity-based smart contracts with minimal to no changes. Substrate makes this integration possible - just plug the [EVM pallet](https://docs.rs/pallet-evm/2.0.1/pallet_evm){target=\_blank} into your runtime for EVM support, and the [Ethereum Pallet with Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} to have Ethereum RPC compatibility. The availability of these open-source modules that Moonbeam has developed with Parity has led multiple parachains to offer Ethereum compatibility on their chains.

But there is an important catch. With the configuration described above, a user, for example, Alice, can have an Ethereum-style address (H160 format), which is 40+2 hex-characters long, in a Substrate based chain. This address matches a private key, which can be used to sign transactions in the Ethereum side of the chain. Furthermore, the address is mapped into a storage slot inside the Substrate Balance pallet to a Substrate-style address (H256 format).

However, Alice only knows the private key of the H160 address, and not of the mapped version. Therefore, she is unable to send transactions with her H256 address and is limited only to do read-only operations through Substrate’s API. As a consequence, Alice needs another H256 address matching a different private key to be able to operate in the Substrate side of the chain, which include, among others, staking, balances, and governance.

The following diagram illustrates this configuration.

![Old account system diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/unified-accounts-1.webp)

This can creates friction and a poor user experience for Alice. First, she has to move tokens to her H160 mapped H256 address to be able to make transactions and deploy contracts through the EVM. Second, she also needs to hold a balance in her other H256 address (which she has a different private key for) to use Substrate-based features. So in short, Alice needs a minimum of two private keys to have the best of both worlds.

## Moonbeam Unified Accounts {: #moonbeam-unified-accounts }

Moonbeam’s focus is to create a fully Ethereum-compatible environment on Polkadot with the best user experience possible. This extends beyond the base Ethereum feature set, with additional features such as on-chain governance, staking, and cross-chain integrations.

With unified accounts, a user, for example, Bob, will only need a single H160 address, with its corresponding private key, to do everything we mentioned above, including both EVM and Substrate functions.

The diagram for this new configuration looks as follows.

![New account system diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/unified-accounts-2.webp)

That is it, Bob only holds one private key that matches one address. He does not need to move balances between 2 different accounts and is able to access all the features with a single account and private key. We have standardized this single account to conform to the Ethereum-style H160 address and ECDSA key standards.

# Nimbus Parachain Consensus Framework

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Polkadot relies on a [hybrid consensus model](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/). In such a scheme, the block finality gadget and the block production mechanism are separate. Consequently, parachains only have to worry about producing blocks and rely on the relay chain to validate the state transitions.

At a parachain level, block producers are called [collators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-collator/). They maintain parachains (such as Moonbeam) by collecting transactions from users and offering blocks to the relay chain [validators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-validator/).

However, parachains might find the following problems they need to solve in a trustless and decentralized matter (if applicable):

 - Amongst all of the nodes in the network, which ones are allowed to author blocks?
 - If multiple nodes are allowed, will they be eligible at the same time? Only one? Maybe a few?

Enter Nimbus. Nimbus is a framework for building slot-based consensus algorithms on [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/cumulus)-based parachains. It strives to provide standard implementations for the logistical parts of such consensus engines and helpful traits for implementing the elements (filters) that researchers and developers want to customize. These filters can be customizable to define what a block authorship slot is and can be composed, so block authorship is restricted to a subset of collators in multiple steps.

For example, Moonbeam uses a two-layer approach. The first layer comprises the parachain staking filter, which helps select an active collator pool among all collator candidates using a staked-based ranking. The second layer adds another filter which narrows down the number of collators to a subset for each slot.

Notice that Nimbus can only answer which collator(s) are eligible to produce a parachain block in the next available slot. It is the [Cumulus](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/#cumulus) consensus mechanism that marks this parachain block as best, and ultimately the [BABE](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#babe) and [GRANDPA](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#grandpa-finality-gadget) hybrid consensus model (of the relay chain) that will include this parachain block in the relay chain and finalize it. Once any relay chain forks are resolved at a relay chain level, that parachain block is deterministically finalized.

The following two sections go over the filtering strategy currently used on Moonbeam.

## Parachain Staking Filtering {: #parachain-staking-filtering }

Collators can join the candidate pool by simply bonding some tokens via an extrinsic. Once in the pool, token holders can add to the candidate's stake via delegation (also referred to as staking), that is, at a parachain level.

Parachain staking is the first of the two Nimbus filters applied to the candidate pool. It selects the top {{ networks.moonbase.staking.max_candidates }} candidates in terms of tokens staked in the network, which includes the candidate's bond and delegations from token holders. This filtered pool is called selected candidates, and selected candidates are renewed every round (which lasts {{ networks.moonbase.staking.round_blocks }} blocks). For a given round, the following diagram describes the parachain staking filtering:

![Nimbus Parachain Staking Filter](/images/learn/features/consensus/consensus-1.webp)

From this pool, another filter is applied to retrieve a subset of eligible candidates for the next block authoring slot.

If you want to learn more about staking, visit our [staking documentation](/learn/features/staking/).

## Fixed Size Subset Filtering {: #fixed-size-subset-filtering }

Once the parachain staking filter is applied and the selected candidates are retrieved, a second filter is applied on a block by block basis and helps narrow down the selected candidates to a smaller number of eligible collators for the next block authoring slot.

In broad terms, this second filter picks a pseudo-random subset of the previously selected candidates. The eligibility ratio, a tunable parameter, defines the size of this subset.

A high eligibility ratio results in fewer chances for the network to skip a block production slot, as more collators will be eligible to propose a block for a specific slot. However, only a certain number of validators are assigned to a parachain, meaning that most of these blocks will not be backed by a validator. For those that are, a higher number of backed blocks means that it might take longer for the relay chain to solve any possible forks and return a finalized block. Moreover, this might create an unfair advantage for certain collators that might be able to get their proposed block faster to relay chain validators, securing a higher portion of block rewards (if any).

A lower eligibility ratio might provide faster block finalization times and a fairer block production distribution amongst collators. However, if the eligible collators are not able to propose a block (for whatever reason), the network will skip a block, affecting its stability.

Once the size of the subset is defined, collators are randomly selected using a source of entropy. Currently, an internal coin-flipping algorithm is implemented, but this will later be migrated to use [Verifiable random function](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/parachain-basics/randomness/){target=\_blank}. Consequently, a new subset of eligible collators is selected for every relay chain block. For a given round and a given block `XYZ`, the following diagram describes the fixed-size subset filtering:

![Nimbus Parachain Staking Filter](/images/learn/features/consensus/consensus-2.webp)

## Why Nimbus? {: #why-nimbus }

You might ask yourself: but why Nimbus? Initially, it was not envisioned when Moonbeam was being developed. As Moonbeam progressed, the necessity for a more customizable but straightforward parachain consensus mechanism became clear, as the available methods presented some drawbacks or technical limitations.

<!-- In the [relay chain provided consensus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/blob/master/client/consensus/relay-chain/src/lib.rs), each node sees itself as a collator and can propose a parachain candidate block. It is then up to the relay chain to solve any possible forks and finalize a block. 

[AuRa](https://crates.io/crates/sc-consensus-aura) (short for authority-round) consensus mechanism is based on a known list of authorities that take turns to produce blocks in every slot. Each authority can propose only one block per slot and builds on top of the longest chain.-->

With Nimbus, writing a parachain consensus engine is as easy as writing a pallet! This simplicity and flexibility is the main value it adds.

Some technical benefits of Nimbus are considered in the following sections.

### Weight and Extra Execution {: #weight-and-extra-execution }

Nimbus puts the author-checking execution in a [Substrate pallet](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/overview/). At first glance, you might think this adds a higher execution load to a single block compared to doing this check off-chain. But consider this from a validator’s perspective

The validators will also have to check the author. By putting the author-checking execution logic in a pallet, the execution time can be benchmarked and quantified with weights. If this execution time is not accounted for, there is the risk of a block exceeding the relay chain Wasm execution limit (currently 0.5 seconds).

In practice, this check will be fast and will most likely not push execution time over the limit. But from a theoretical perspective, accounting for its weight is better for implementation purposes.

### Reusability {: #reusability }

Another benefit of moving the author-checking execution to a pallet, rather than a custom executor, is that one single executor can be reused for any consensus that can be expressed in the Nimbus framework. That is slot-based, signature-sealed algorithms.

For example, the [relay-chain provided consensus](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/cumulus/client/consensus/relay-chain/src/lib.rs), [AuRa](https://crates.io/crates/sc-consensus-aura) and [BABE](https://crates.io/crates/sc-consensus-babe) each have their own custom executor. With Nimbus, these consensus mechanisms can reuse the same executor. The power of reusability is evidenced by the Nimbus implementation of AuRa in less than 100 lines of code.

### Hot-Swapping Consensus {: #hot-swapping-consensus }

Teams building parachains may want to change, tune, or adjust their consensus algorithm from time to time. Without nimbus, swapping consensus would require a client upgrade and hard fork.

With the Nimbus framework, writing a consensus engine is as easy as writing a
[Substrate pallet](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/make-custom-pallet/). Consequently, swapping consensus is as easy as upgrading a pallet.

Nonetheless, hot swapping is still bounded by consensus engines (filters) that fit within Nimbus, but it might be helpful for teams that are yet confident on what consensus they want to implement in the long run.

# Ethereum Compatibility

Moonbeam bridges the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems, offering developers the familiarity of Ethereum's tooling and infrastructure while leveraging Polkadot's scalability and interoperability.

This documentation overviews Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility features and highlights its key components. It also covers some critical differences between Moonbeam and Ethereum so Ethereum developers know what to expect.

## Key Components {: #key-components }

### EVM Compatibility {: #evm }

Moonbeam incorporates a fully compatible EVM to execute smart contracts in Solidity or other EVM-compatible languages. This enables developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts on Moonbeam with minimal modifications.

Learn more:

- [Moonbeam's Ethereum-compatibility architecture](/learn/platform/technology/#ethereum-compatibility-architecture){target=\_blank}

### Ethereum-style Accounts {: #ethereum-style-accounts }

Moonbeam employs H160 Ethereum-style accounts and ECDSA keys, ensuring compatibility with existing Ethereum wallets and facilitating a smooth end-user experience. This is possible due to Moonbeam's unified accounts system, which modifies the underlying Substrate account system to use Ethereum accounts by default.

Learn more:

- [Moonbeam's unified accounts system](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank}

### JSON-RPC Support {: #json-rpc-support }

Moonbeam offers full JSON-RPC compatibility with Ethereum, allowing developers to interact with Moonbeam nodes using familiar Ethereum tools and libraries. This compatibility extends to methods for account management, transaction submission, smart contract deployment, and event monitoring.

In addition to standard Ethereum RPC methods, Moonbeam supports non-standard Debug and Trace modules, providing developers with enhanced debugging and tracing capabilities for smart contract execution. The Debug module allows developers to inspect internal state transitions and execution traces, enabling efficient debugging of complex smart contracts. The Trace module provides detailed transaction traces, including opcode-level execution information and gas consumption, facilitating performance analysis and optimization.

- [Subscribe to events with Ethereum JSON-RPC methods](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/pubsub/){target=\_blank}
- [Debug and trace transactions with non-standard RPC methods](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/){target=\_blank}

### Ethereum Developer Tools and Libraries {: #ethereum-dev-tools }

With the underlying support for Ethereum JSON-RPC methods, Moonbeam leverages Ethereum's rich ecosystem of developer libraries and environments. With seamless integration of popular Ethereum libraries and development environments, developers can leverage their existing knowledge and tooling to build and deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on Moonbeam.

Learn more:

- [Ethereum libraries](/builders/ethereum/libraries/){target=\_blank}
- [Ethereum development environments](/builders/ethereum/libraries/){target=\_blank}

### Precompiled Contracts {: #precompiled-contracts }

Moonbeam provides precompiled contracts that allow Ethereum smart contracts to seamlessly access Substrate functionality. These precompiled contracts expose Substrate features such as on-chain governance, staking, and identity management to Ethereum-based DApps on Moonbeam. This integration ensures that Ethereum developers can harness the full potential of Moonbeam's features, expanding the possibilities for dApp development on Moonbeam.

In addition, developers can leverage Ethereum MainNet precompiles seamlessly within their smart contracts on Moonbeam. These precompiled contracts, widely used on the Ethereum network, offer optimized and efficient execution of common cryptographic operations and complex computations. By supporting Ethereum MainNet precompiles, Moonbeam ensures compatibility with Ethereum-based dApps while enabling developers to utilize familiar tools and libraries to build on its platform.

Learn more:

- [Overview of the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/overview/){target=\_blank}

### Ethereum Token Standards {: #ethereum-token-standards }

Moonbeam supports Ethereum token standards, allowing developers to deploy and interact with tokens that adhere to popular standards such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. By supporting these standards, Moonbeam enables developers to deploy existing Ethereum tokens without modification.

Due to Moonbeam's native interoperability, ERC-20s can be sent cross-chain to other chains within the Polkadot ecosystem via Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM).

Learn more:

- [Create common OpenZeppelin contracts such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/openzeppelin/contracts/){target=\_blank}
- [XCM-enabled ERC-20s](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/#local-xc20s){target=\_blank} (also referred to as local XC-20s)

## Key Differences {: #key-differences }

### Consensus Mechanisms {: #consensus-mechanisms }

Moonbeam uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, where token holders in the network can delegate candidates to become block producers, known as _collators_. On the other hand, Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system in which validators are selected based on their stake in the network to produce and validate blocks.

Learn more:

- [Differences between PoS and DPoS](/learn/core-concepts/consensus-finality/#main-differences){target=_blank}

### Finality {: #finality }

Moonbeam and Ethereum have different finality processes. On Ethereum, there is a checkpoint system where validators determine finality at checkpoint blocks, which takes at least 6.4 minutes for a block to be finalized. Moonbeam relies on Polkadot's [GRANDPA](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#finality-gadget-grandpa){target=\_blank} finality gadget, which expedites finality by completing the process parallel to block production and allowing relay chain validators to vote on the highest block, finalizing all blocks leading up to that block.

Learn more:

- [Consensus and finality on Moonbeam](/learn/core-concepts/consensus-finality/){target=_blank}

### Proxy Accounts {: #proxy-accounts }

On both Moonbeam and Ethereum, accounts can be controlled by two main types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) or smart contracts. However, on Moonbeam, within both account types, there are also proxy accounts, which can perform a limited number of actions on behalf of another account.

Learn more:

- [An overview of proxy accounts](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-proxies/){target=\_blank}
- [How to set up a proxy account](/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/){target=\_blank}

### Account Balances {: #account-balances }

Balances on Ethereum are fairly straightforward; if an account holds tokens, that account has a token balance. On Moonbeam, different balance types exist to support various Substrate functionality. There are five types: free, reducible, reserved, miscellaneous frozen, and fee frozen. When using Ethereum tools, accounts show the reducible balance and don't include locked or frozen balances.

Learn more:

- [Moonbeam account balances](/learn/core-concepts/balances/){target=_blank}

### Balance Transfers {: #balance-transfers }

Since Moonbeam is a Substrate-based chain, balance transfers of the native asset (GLMR, MOVR, and DEV) can occur through the Ethereum and Substrate APIs. Like Ethereum, transfers sent through the Ethereum API rely on the `eth_sendRawTransaction`. Transfers sent through the Substrate API are done using the Balances Pallet, a built-in module in the Substrate framework that provides functionality for managing accounts and balances.

Learn more:

- [Balance transfers on Moonbeam](/learn/core-concepts/transfers-api/){target=_blank}

### Transaction Fees {: #transaction-fees }

Moonbeam and Ethereum calculate transaction fees differently due to variations in their underlying architectures and consensus mechanisms. The fundamental difference in how transaction fees are calculated is that Ethereum uses a gas-based fee system, and Moonbeam uses a weight-based system that maps to the gas used. Moonbeam also implements additional metrics in the underlying gas calculations, including proof size and storage costs.

# Governance on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The goal of Moonbeam’s governance mechanism is to advance the protocol according to the desires of the community. In that shared mission, the governance process seeks to include all token holders. Any and all changes to the protocol must go through a referendum so that all token holders, weighted by stake, can have input on the decision.

Governance forums like the [Moonbeam Community Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} and [Polkassembly](https://moonbeam.polkassembly.io/opengov){target=\_blank} enable open discussion and allow proposals to be refined based on community input. Autonomous enactments and [forkless upgrades](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/maintenance/runtime-upgrades/#forkless-upgrades){target=\_blank} unite the community towards a shared mission to advance the protocol.

With the rollout of OpenGov (originally referred to as Gov2), the second phase of governance in Polkadot, several modifications have been introduced to the governance process. You can read the [OpenGov: What is Polkadot Gov2](https://moonbeam.network/news/opengov-what-is-polkadot-gov2){target=\_blank} blog post, which provides an overview of all of the changes made in OpenGov.

As of runtime 2400, all Moonbeam networks use OpenGov as their governance system.

## Principles {: #principles }

Guiding "soft" principles for engagement with Moonbeam's governance process include:

 - Being inclusive to token holders that want to engage with Moonbeam and that are affected by governance decisions
 - Favoring token holder engagement, even with views contrary to our own, versus a lack of engagement
 - A commitment to openness and transparency in the decision-making process
 - Working to keep the greater good of the network above personal gain
 - Acting at all times as a moral agent that considers the consequences of action (or inaction) from a moral standpoint
 - Being patient and generous in our interactions with other token holders, but not tolerating abusive or destructive language, actions, and behavior, and abiding by [Moonbeam’s Code of Conduct](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/code-of-conduct){target=\_blank}

These points were heavily inspired by Vlad Zamfir’s writings on governance. Refer to his articles, especially the [How to Participate in Blockchain Governance in Good Faith (and with Good Manners)](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/how-to-participate-in-blockchain-governance-in-good-faith-and-with-good-manners-bd4e16846434){target=\_blank} Medium article.

## On-Chain Governance Mechanics {: #on-chain-governance-mechanics }

The "hard" governance process for Moonbeam will be driven by an on-chain process that allows the majority of tokens on the network to determine the outcomes of key decisions around the network. These decision points come in the form of stake-weighted voting on proposed referenda.

Some of the main components of this governance model include:

 - **Referenda** — a stake-based voting scheme where each referendum is tied to a specific proposal for a change to the Moonbeam system including values for key parameters, code upgrades, or changes to the governance system itself
 - **Voting** — referenda will be voted on by token holders on a stake-weighted basis. Referenda which pass are subject to delayed enactment so that people who disagree with the direction of the decision have time to exit the network
 - **Council & Technical Committee Governance V1** — a group of community members who have special voting rights within the system. With the deprecation and removal of Governance v1, both of these committees were dissolved as of the [runtime 2800 release](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/runtime-rt2801-schedule/1616/4){target=\_blank}
 - **OpenGov Technical Committee** — a group of community members who can add certain proposals to the Whitelisted Track

For more details on how these Substrate frame pallets implement on-chain governance, you can checkout the [Walkthrough of Polkadot’s Governance](https://polkadot.com/blog/a-walkthrough-of-polkadots-governance){target=\_blank} blog post and the [Polkadot Governance Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/){target=\_blank}.

## Governance v2: OpenGov {: #opengov }

This section will cover everything you need to know about OpenGov on Moonbeam.

### General Definitions {: #general-definitions-gov2 }

- **Proposal** — an action or item, defined by the preimage hash, being proposed by a token holder and open for consideration and discussion by token holders
 - **Referendum** — a proposal that is up for token-holder voting. Each referendum is tied to a specific proposal for a change to the Moonbeam system including values for key parameters, code upgrades, or changes to the governance system itself

- **Preimage hash** — hash of the proposal to be enacted. The first step to make a proposal is to submit a preimage. The hash is just its identifier. The proposer of the preimage can be different than the user that proposes that preimage as a formal proposal
 - **Preimage deposit** — amount of tokens that the proposer needs to bond when submitting a preimage. It is calculated as the sum of a base deposit per network plus a fee per byte of the preimage being proposed

 - **Origin** - an authorization-based dispatch source for an operation, which is used to determine the Track that a referendum is posted under
 - **Track** - an Origin-specific pipeline that outlines the life cycle of proposals. Currently, there are five Tracks:

    |    Origin Track     |                                   Description                                    |                         Referendum Examples                          |
    |:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |        Root         |                                Highest privilege                                 |           Runtime upgrades, Technical Committee management           |
    |     Whitelisted     | Proposals to be whitelisted by the Technical Committee before being dispatched |                       Fast-tracked operations                        |
    |    General Admin    |                          For general on-chain decisions                          | Changes to XCM fees, Orbiter program, Staking parameters, Registrars |
    | Emergency Canceller |          For cancellation of a referendum. Decision Deposit is refunded          |                    Wrongly constructed referendum                    |
    |  Emergency Killer   |       For killing of bad/malicious referendum. Decision Deposit is slashed       |                         Malicious referendum                         |
    | Fast General Admin  |                      For faster general on-chain decisions                       |                       HRMP channel management                        |

Tracks have different criteria parameters that are proportional to their level of Origin class. For example, more dangerous and privileged referenda will have more safeguards, higher thresholds, and longer consideration periods for approval. Please refer to the [Governance Parameters](#governance-parameters-v2) section for more information.

- **Voting** — a mechanism for token holders to support (Aye), oppose (Nay), or remain neutral (Abstain) on a proposal. For Aye and Nay, the voting weight is determined by both the number of tokens locked and the lock duration (Conviction). Abstain votes do not receive additional weighting
    - **Conviction** — the time that token holders voluntarily lock their tokens when voting; the longer they are locked, the more weight their vote has
    - **Lock balance** — the number of tokens that a user commits to a vote (note, this is not the same as a user's total account balance)
    Moonbeam uses the concept of voluntary locking, which allows token holders to increase their voting power by locking tokens for a longer period of time. Specifying no Lock Period means a user's vote is valued at 10% of their lock balance. Specifying a greater Conviction increases voting power. For each increase in Conviction (vote multiplier), the Lock Periods double

- **Approval** — minimum "Aye" votes as a percentage of overall Conviction-weighted votes needed for approval
 - **Support** — the minimum portion of Aye and Abstain votes (ignoring conviction) needed as a percentage of the total active supply for a proposal to pass. Nay votes do not count toward Support

- **Lead-in Period** — the initial proposal voting and discussion period. At this stage, proposals are in an undecided state until they pass some criteria for the given Track. The criteria include:
    - **Prepare Period** — the minimum time the referendum needs to wait before it can progress to the next phase after submission
    - **Capacity** — limit for the number of referenda on a given Track that can be decided at once
    - **Decision Deposit** — the minimum deposit amount required for a referendum to progress to the decision phase after the end of the Lead-in Period. Since each Track has a defined Capacity, this deposit is larger than the submission deposit, and its goal is to mitigate spam
    
 - **Decide Period** - token holders continue to vote on the referendum. If a referendum does not pass by the end of the period, it will be rejected, and the Decision Deposit will be refunded
 - **Confirm Period** - a period of time within the Decide Period where the referendum needs to have maintained enough Approval and Support to be approved and move to the Enactment Period
 - **Enactment Period** - a specified time, which is defined at the time the proposal was created, that an approved referendum waits before it can be dispatched. There is a minimum amount of time for each Track

- **Vote Delegation** — a voter can give their voting power, including Conviction voting, to another token holder (delegate), who may be more knowledgeable and able to make specific decisions
 - **Multirole Delegation** — the ability to delegate voting power on a Track-by-Track basis, where a token holder can specify different delegates for each Track

!!! note
    As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.

#### Conviction Multiplier {: #conviction-multiplier-v2 }

The Conviction multiplier is related to the number of Enactment Periods the tokens will be locked for after the referenda is enacted (if approved). Consequently, the longer you are willing to lock your tokens, the stronger your vote will be weighted. You also have the option of not locking tokens at all, but vote weight is drastically reduced (tokens are still locked during the duration of the referendum).

If you were to vote 1000 tokens with a 6x Conviction, your weighted vote would be 6000 units. That is, 1000 locked tokens multiplied by the Conviction, which in this scenario would be 6. On the other hand, if you decided you didn't want to have your tokens locked after enactment, you could vote your 1000 tokens with a 0.1x Conviction. In this case, your weighted vote would only be 100 units.

The Conviction multiplier values for each network are:

### Roadmap of a Proposal {: #roadmap-of-a-proposal-v2 }

Before a proposal is submitted, the author of the proposal can submit their proposal idea to the designated Democracy Proposals section of the [Moonbeam Governance discussion forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/2){target=\_blank} for feedback from the community for at least five days. From there, the author can make adjustments to the proposal based on the feedback they've collected.

Once the author is ready, they can submit their proposal on-chain. To do so, first, they need to submit the preimage of the proposal. The submitter needs to bond a fee to store the preimage on-chain. The bond is returned once the submitter unnotes the preimage. Next, they can submit the actual proposal and pay the Submission Deposit, which is enough to cover the on-chain storage cost of the proposal. Then the Lead-in Period begins and the community can begin voting "Aye" or "Nay" on the proposal by locking tokens. In order for the referendum to advance and move out of the Lead-in Period to the Decide period, the following criteria must be met:

- The referendum must wait the duration of the Prepare Period, which allows for adequate time to discuss the proposal before it progresses to the next phase
- There is enough Capacity in the chosen Track
- A Decision Deposit has been made that meets the minimum requirements for the Track

If a referendum meets the above criteria, it moves to the Decide Period and takes up one of the spots in its designated Track. In the Decide Period, voting continues and the referendum has a set amount of days to reach the Approval and Support requirements needed for it to progress to the Confirm Period.

Once in the Confirm Period, a referendum must continuously meet the Approval and Support requirements for the duration of the period. If a referendum fails to meet the requirements at any point, it is returned to the Decide Period. If the referendum meets the Approval and Support requirements again, it can progress to the Confirm Period again and the Decide Period will be delayed until the end of the Confirm Period. If the Decide Period ends and not enough Approval and Support was received, the referendum will be rejected and the Decision Deposit will be returned. The proposal can be proposed again at any time.

If a referendum continuously receives enough Approval and Support during the Confirm Period, it will be approved and move to the Enactment Period. It will wait the duration of the Enactment Period before it gets dispatched.

The happy path for a proposal is shown in the following diagram:

![A happy path diagram of the proposal roadmap in OpenGov.](/images/learn/features/governance/proposal-roadmap.webp)

### Proposal Example Walkthrough

A proposal (with its preimage) is submitted for the General Admin Track on Moonriver would have the following characteristics:

 - The Approval curve starts at {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.percent0 }}% on {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.time0 }}, goes to {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.percent1 }}% on {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.time1 }}
 - The Support curve starts at {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_support.percent0 }}% on {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_support.time0 }}, goes to {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_support.percent1 }}% on {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_support.time1 }}
 - A referendum starts the Decide Period with 0% "Aye" votes (nobody voted in the Lead-in Period)
 - Token holders begin to vote and the Approval increases to a value above {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.percent1 }}% by {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.time1 }}
 - If the Approval and Support thresholds are met for the duration of the Confirm Period ({{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.confirm_period.blocks }} blocks, approximately {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.confirm_period.time }}), the referendum is approved
 - If the Approval and Support thresholds are not met during the Decision Period, the proposal is rejected. Note that the thresholds need to be met for the duration of the Confirm Period. Consequently, if they are met but the Decision Period expires before the completion of the Confirm Period, the proposal is rejected

The Approval and Support percentages can be calculated using the following:

=== "Approval"

    ```text
    Approval = 100 * ( Total Conviction-weighted "Aye" votes / Total Conviction-weighted votes ) 
    ```

=== "Support"

    ```text
    Support = 100 * ( Total Aye + Abstain votes, ignoring conviction / Total supply )
    ```

### Proposal Cancellations {: #proposal-cancellations }

In the event that a proposal already in the voting stage is found to have an issue, it may be necessary to prevent its approval. These instances may involve malicious activity or technical issues that make the changes impossible to implement due to recent upgrades to the network.

Cancellations must be voted on by the network to be executed. Cancellation proposals are faster than a typical proposal because they must be decided before the enactment of the proposal they seek to cancel, but they follow the same process as other referenda.

There is a cancellation Origin for use against referenda that contain an unforeseen problem, called the Emergency Canceller. The Emergency Canceller Origin and the Root Origin are allowed to cancel referenda. Regardless of the Origin, if a proposal is cancelled, it gets rejected and the Decision Deposit gets refunded.

In addition, there is a Kill Origin, which is for bad referenda intending to harm the network, called Emergency Killer. The Emergency Killer Origin and the Root Origin have the ability to kill referenda. In this case, a proposal is cancelled and the Decision Deposit is slashed, meaning the deposit amount is burned regardless of the Origin.

### Rights of the OpenGov Technical Committee {: #rights-of-the-opengov-technical-committee }

On Polkadot, the Technical Committee from Governance v1 was replaced with the Fellowship, which is a "mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Kusama and/or Polkadot networks and protocol," according to [Polkadot's wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/web3-and-polkadot/#fellowship){target=\_blank}.

For Moonbeam's implementation of OpenGov, instead of the Fellowship, there is a community OpenGov Technical Committee that has very similar power to that of the Fellowship. Their power in governance resides in their ability to whitelist a proposal. OpenGov Technical Committee members may only vote to whitelist a proposal if whitelisting that proposal would protect against a security vulnerability to the network. The passing threshold of the OpenGov Technical Committee members on whether to whitelist a proposal is determined by governance. As such, the OpenGov Technical Committee has very limited power over the network. Its purpose is to provide technical review of urgent security issues that are proposed by token holders.

While still subject to governance, the idea behind the Whitelist track is that it will have different parameters to make it faster for proposals to pass. The Whitelist Track parameters, including approval, support, and voting, are determined by the Moonriver or Moonbeam token holders through governance and cannot be changed by the OpenGov Technical Committee.

The OpenGov Technical Committee is made up of members of the community who have technical knowledge and expertise in Moonbeam-based networks.

# Randomness on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Randomness is necessary for a variety of blockchain applications to create unbiased, unpredictable, and unique outcomes. However, obtaining a reliable source of randomness is a challenge. Computers are deterministic, meaning given the same input, the same output will always be produced. Therefore, random values generated by computers are referred to as pseudo-random as they appear to be statistically random, but given the same input, the output can easily be repeated.

Moonbeam utilizes verifiable random functions (VRF) to generate randomness that can be verified on-chain. A VRF is a cryptographic function that takes some input and produces random values, along with a proof of authenticity that they were generated by the submitter. The proof can be verified by anyone to ensure that the random values were generated correctly.

There are two available sources of randomness that provide random inputs based on block producers' VRF keys and past randomness results: [local VRF](#local-vrf) and [BABE epoch randomness](#babe-epoch-randomness). Local VRF is determined directly within Moonbeam using the collator of the block's VRF key and the last block's VRF output. On the other hand, [BABE](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#block-production-babe){target=\_blank} epoch randomness is based on all the VRF produced by the relay chain validators during a complete [epoch](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/glossary/#epoch){target=\_blank}.

You can interact with and request on-chain randomness using the Randomness Precompile contract, a Solidity interface that enables smart contract developers to access the randomness functionality through the Ethereum API. For more information, please check out the [Interacting with the Randomness Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/){target=\_blank} guide. You can also take a look at the [Randomness Pallet](/builders/substrate/interfaces/features/randomness/){target=\_blank}, which can be used to obtain current randomness requests and results.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

- **Epoch** - a time duration in the BABE protocol that is broken into smaller time slots. Slots are discrete units of time six seconds in length. On Polkadot, one epoch lasts approximately 2,400 slots or 4 hours. On Kusama, one epoch lasts approximately 600 slots or 1 hour.
- **Deposit** - an amount of funds required to request random words. There is one deposit per request. Once the request has been fulfilled, the deposit will be returned to the account that requested the randomness
- **Block expiration delay** - the number of blocks that must pass before a local VRF request expires and can be purged
- **Epoch expiration delay** - the number of epochs that must pass before a BABE request expires and can be purged
- **Minimum block delay** - the minimum number of blocks before a request can be fulfilled for local VRF requests
- **Maximum block delay** - the maximum number of blocks before a request can be fulfilled for local VRF requests
- **Maximum random words** - the maximum number of random words being requested
- **Epoch fulfillment delay** - the delay in epochs before a request can be fulfilled for a BABE request

## Local VRF {: #local-vrf }

Local VRF randomness is generated on a block-by-block basis at the beginning of the block using the previous block's VRF output along with the public key of the current block author's VRF key. The generated randomness result is stored and used to fulfill all randomness requests for the current block.

You can request local VRF randomness using the [`requestLocalVRFRandomWords` method](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/#:~:text=requestLocalVRFRandomWords){target=\_blank} of the [Randomness Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/){target=\_blank}.

If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the `requestId` returned from the `requestLocalVRFRandomWords` method to track which response is associated with which randomness request.

## BABE Epoch Randomness {: #babe-epoch-randomness }

BABE epoch randomness is based on a hash of the VRF values from the blocks produced in the relay chain epoch before last. On Polkadot, an [epoch lasts for roughly 4 hours](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-cryptography/#vrf){target=\_blank}, and on Kusama, an [epoch lasts for roughly 1 hour](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/maintain-polkadot-parameters#periods-of-common-actions-and-attributes){target=\_blank}. The hashing is completed on the relay chain, and as such, it is not possible for a collator on Moonbeam to influence the randomness value unless they are also a validator on the relay chain and were responsible for producing the last output included in an epoch.

The randomness remains constant during an epoch. If a collator skips block production, the next eligible collator can fulfill the request using the same random value.

You can request BABE epoch randomness using the [`requestRelayBabeEpochRandomWords` method](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/#:~:text=requestRelayBabeEpochRandomWords){target=\_blank} of the [Randomness Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/){target=\_blank}. In order to generate unique randomness, a different salt must be provided to the `requestRelayBabeEpochRandomWords` function.

At the beginning of each relay chain epoch change, the randomness from one epoch ago is read from the relay chain state proof and used to fulfill all randomness requests that are due in the current block.

## Request & Fulfill Process {: #request-and-fulfill-process }

In general, the request and fulfill process for randomness is as follows:

1. Pay the deposit required to request random words
2. Request the randomness either using the local VRF or BABE epoch source of randomness. When requesting randomness you'll need to specify a few things:

    - a refund address where any excess fees will be sent to
    - the amount of fees which will be set aside to pay for fulfillment. If the specified amount is not enough you can always increase the request fees later, or if it's more than enough you'll be refunded the excess fees to the specified address after fulfillment
    - a unique salt that will be used to generate different random words
    - the number of random words you would like to request
    - for local VRF, the delay period in blocks, which is used to increase unpredictability. It must be between the [minimum and maximum number of blocks](#quick-reference) as listed above. For BABE epoch randomness, you do not need to specify a delay but can fulfill the request after the [epoch delay](#quick-reference) has passed

3. Wait for the delay period to pass
4. Fulfill the randomness request, which triggers the random words to be computed using the current block's randomness result and the given salt. This can manually be done by anyone using the fee that was initially set aside for the request
5. For fulfilled requests, the random words are returned and the cost of execution will be refunded from the request fee to the address that initiated the fulfillment. Then any excess fees and the request deposit are transferred to the specified refund address

If a request expires it can be purged by anyone. When this happens, the request fee is paid out to the address that initiated the purge and the deposit is returned to the original requester.

The happy path for a randomness request is shown in the following diagram:

![Randomness request happy path diagram](/images/learn/features/randomness/randomness-1.webp)

## Security Considerations {: #security-considerations }

A method with the ability to call your `fulfillRandomness` method directly could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that it can only be directly called by the `RandomnessConsumer.sol` contract's `rawFulfillRandomness` method.

For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your `fulfillRandomness` method. If your contract must store the response (or anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.

Similarly, the collators have some influence over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously, you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.

Since the output of the random words generated for `requestLocalVRFRandomWords` is dependent on the collator producing the block at fulfillment, the collator could skip its block, forcing the fulfillment to be executed by a different collator and therefore generating a different VRF. However, such an attack would incur the cost of losing the block reward to the collator. It is also possible for a collator to be able to predict some of the possible outcome of the VRF if the delay between the request and the fulfillment is too short. It is for this reason that you can choose to provide a higher delay.

Since the output of the random words generated for `requestRelayBabeEpochRandomWords` is dependent on the relay chain validator producing the blocks during an epoch, it is possible for the last validator of an epoch to choose between two possible VRF outputs by skipping the production of a block. However, such an attack would incur the cost of losing the block reward to the validator. It is not possible for a parachain collator to predict or influence the output of the relay chain VRF, not to censor the fulfillment, as long as there is one honest collator.

# Staking on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam uses a block production mechanism based on [Polkadot's Proof-of-Stake model](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/){target=\_blank}, where there are collators and validators. [Collators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-collator/){target=\_blank} maintain parachains (in this case, Moonbeam) by collecting transactions from users and producing state transition proofs for the relay chain [validators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-validator/){target=\_blank}.

The candidates in the active set of collators (nodes that produce blocks) are selected based on their stake in the network. And here is where staking comes in.

Collator candidates (and token holders if they delegate) have a stake in the network. The top N candidates by staked amount are chosen to produce blocks with a valid set of transactions, where N is a configurable parameter. Part of each block reward goes to the collators that produced the block, who then share it with the delegators considering their percental contributions towards the collator's stake. In such a way, network members are incentivized to stake tokens to improve the overall security. Since staking is done at a protocol level through the staking interface, if you choose to delegate, the collators you delegate to do not have access to your tokens.

To easily manage staking related actions, you can visit the [Moonbeam Network DApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} and use the network tabs at the top of the page to easily switch between Moonbeam networks. To learn how to use the DApp, you can check out the [How to Stake MOVR Tokens](https://moonbeam.network/news/how-to-stake-movr-tokens-on-moonriver-and-earn-staking-rewards){target=\_blank} guide or [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GwetYmzEJM){target=\_blank}, both of which can be adapted for the Moonbeam and the Moonbase Alpha TestNet.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

Some important parameters to understand in relation to the staking system on Moonbeam include:

 - **Round** — a specific number of blocks around which staking actions are enforced. For example, new delegations are enacted when the next round starts. When bonding less or revoking delegations, funds are returned after a specified number of rounds
 - **Candidates** - node operators that are eligible to become block producers if they can acquire enough stake to be in the active set
 - **Collators** — active set of candidates that are selected to be block producers. They collect transactions from users and produce state transition proofs for the relay chain to validate
 - **Delegators** — token holders who stake tokens, vouching for specific collator candidates. Any user that holds a minimum amount of tokens as [free balance](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-accounts/#balance-types#balance-types) can become a delegator
 - **Minimum delegation per candidate** — minimum amount of tokens to delegate candidates once a user is in the set of delegators
 - **Maximum delegators per candidate** — maximum number of delegators, by staked amount, that a candidate can have which are eligible to receive staking rewards
 - **Maximum delegations** — maximum number of candidates a delegator can delegate
 - **Exit delay** - an exit delay is the amount of rounds before a candidate or delegator can execute a scheduled request to decrease or revoke a bond, or leave the set of candidates or delegators
 - **Reward payout delay** - a certain amount of rounds must pass before staking rewards are distributed automatically to the free balance
 - **Reward pool** - a portion of the annual inflation that is set aside for collators and delegators
 - **Collator commission** - default fixed percent a collator takes off the top of the due staking rewards. Not related to the reward pool
 - **Delegator rewards** — the aggregate delegator rewards distributed over all eligible delegators, taking into account the relative size of stakes ([read more](/learn/features/staking/#reward-distribution))
 - **Auto-compounding** - a setting that automatically applies a percentage of a delegator's rewards to their total amount delegated
 - **Slashing** — a mechanism to discourage collator misbehavior, where typically the collator and their delegators get slashed by losing a percentage of their stake. Currently, there is no slashing but this can be changed through governance. Collators who produce blocks that are not finalized by the relay chain won't receive rewards

!!! note
    As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.

To learn how to get the current value of any of the parameters around staking, check out the [Retrieving Staking Parameters](/tokens/staking/stake/#retrieving-staking-parameters){target=\_blank} section of the [How to Stake your Tokens](/tokens/staking/stake/){target=\_blank} guide.

    The DappLooker Collator dashboard for Moonriver is experimental beta software and may not accurately reflect collator performance. Be sure to do your own research before delegating to a collator.

### General Tips {: #general-tips }

- To optimize your staking rewards, you should generally choose a collator with a lower total amount bonded. In that case, your delegation amount will represent a larger portion of the collator’s total stake and you will earn proportionally higher rewards. However, there is a higher risk of the collator being kicked out of the active set and not earning rewards at all
- The minimum bond for each collator tends to increase over time, so if your delegation is close to the minimum, there is a higher chance you might fall below the minimum and not receive rewards
- Spreading delegations between multiple collators is more efficient in terms of rewards, but only recommended if you have enough to stay above the minimum bond of each collator
- You can consider collator performance by reviewing the number of blocks each collator has produced recently
- You can set up auto-compounding which will automatically restake a specified percentage of your delegation rewards

## Reward Distribution {: #reward-distribution }

Rewards for collators and their delegators are calculated at the start of every round for their work prior to the [reward payout delay](#quick-reference). For example, on Moonriver the rewards are calculated for the collators work from {{ networks.moonriver.delegator_timings.rewards_payouts.rounds }} rounds ago.

The calculated rewards are then paid out on a block-by-block basis starting at the second block of the round. For every block, one collator will be chosen to receive their entire reward payout from the prior round, along with their delegators, until all rewards have been paid out for that round. For example, if there are {{ networks.moonriver.staking.max_candidates }} collators who produced blocks in the prior round, all of the collators and their delegators will be paid by block {{ networks.moonriver.staking.paid_out_block }} of the new round.

You can choose to auto-compound your delegation rewards so you no longer have to manually delegate rewards. If you choose to set up auto-compounding, you can specify the percentage of rewards to be auto-compounded. These rewards will then be automatically added to your delegation.

### Annual Inflation {: #annual-inflation}

The distribution of the annual inflation goes as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"
    |                 Variable                  |                                         Value                                         |
    |:-----------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |             Annual inflation              |               {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.total_annual_inflation }}%               |
    | Rewards pool for collators and delegators | {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.delegator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation |
    |            Collator commission            | {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.collator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |
    |          Parachain bond reserve           |  {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.parachain_bond_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |

=== "Moonriver"
    |                 Variable                  |                                         Value                                          |
    |:-----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |             Annual inflation              |               {{ networks.moonriver.inflation.total_annual_inflation }}%               |
    | Rewards pool for collators and delegators | {{ networks.moonriver.inflation.delegator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation |
    |            Collator commission            | {{ networks.moonriver.inflation.collator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |
    |          Parachain bond reserve           |  {{ networks.moonriver.inflation.parachain_bond_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |

=== "Moonbase Alpha"
    |                 Variable                  |                                         Value                                         |
    |:-----------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |             Annual inflation              |               {{ networks.moonbase.inflation.total_annual_inflation }}%               |
    | Rewards pool for collators and delegators | {{ networks.moonbase.inflation.delegator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation |
    |            Collator commission            | {{ networks.moonbase.inflation.collator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |
    |          Parachain bond reserve           |  {{ networks.moonbase.inflation.parachain_bond_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |

From the rewards pool, collators get the rewards corresponding to their stake in the network. The rest are distributed among delegators by stake.

### Calculating Rewards {: #calculating-rewards }

Mathematically speaking, for collators, the reward distribution per block proposed and finalized would look like this:

![Staking Collator Reward](/images/learn/features/staking/staking-overview-1.webp)

Where `amount_due` is the corresponding inflation being distributed in a specific block, the `stake` corresponds to the number of tokens bonded by the collator in respect to the total stake of that collator (accounting delegations).

For each delegator, the reward distribution (per block proposed and finalized by the delegated collator) would look like this:

![Staking Delegator Reward](/images/learn/features/staking/staking-overview-2.webp)

Where `amount_due` is the corresponding inflation being distributed in a specific block, the `stake` corresponds to the amount of tokens bonded by each delegator in respect to the total stake of that collator.

## Risks {: #risks }

*Holders of MOVR/GLMR tokens should perform careful due diligence on collators before delegating. Being listed as a collator is not an endorsement or recommendation from the Moonbeam Network, the Moonriver Network, or Moonbeam Foundation. Neither the Moonbeam Network, Moonriver Network, nor Moonbeam Foundation has vetted the list collators and assumes no responsibility with regard to the selection, performance, security, accuracy, or use of any third-party offerings.  You alone are responsible for doing your own diligence to understand the applicable fees and all risks present, including actively monitoring the activity of your collators.*

*You agree and understand that neither the Moonbeam Network, the Moonriver Network, nor Moonbeam Foundation guarantees that you will receive staking rewards and any applicable percentage provided (i) is an estimate only and not guaranteed, (ii) may change at any time and (iii) may be more or less than the actual staking rewards you receive. The Moonbeam Foundation makes no representations as to the monetary value of any rewards at any time.*

*Staking MOVR/GLMR tokens is not free of risk.*
*Staked MOVR/GLMR tokens are locked up, and retrieving them requires a {{ networks.moonriver.delegator_timings.del_bond_less.days }} day/{{ networks.moonbeam.delegator_timings.del_bond_less.days }} day waiting period .*
*Additionally, if a collator fails to perform required functions or acts in bad faith, a portion of their total stake can be slashed (i.e. destroyed). This includes the stake of their delegators. If a collators behaves suspiciously or is too often offline, delegators can choose to unbond from them or switch to another collator. Delegators can also mitigate risk by electing to distribute their stake across multiple collators.*

# Treasury on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Moonbeam Treasury is an on-chain collection of funds launched at the network's genesis. Initially pre-funded with 0.5% of the token supply, the Treasury continues to accumulate GLMR as {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.parachain_bond_treasury }}% of the parachain bond reserve inflation goes to the Treasury. For more information about Moonbeam inflation figures, see [GLMR Tokenomics](https://moonbeam.foundation/glimmer-token-tokenomics/){target=\_blank}.

The Moonbeam Treasury funds initiatives that support and grow the network. Stakeholders can propose spending requests for Treasury Council review, focusing on efforts like integrations, collaborations, community events, and outreach. Treasury spend proposers must submit their proposals to the [Moonbeam Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/treasury-proposals/8){target=\_blank}. For submission details, see [How to Propose a Treasury Spend](/tokens/governance/treasury-spend/){target=\_blank}.

The [Treasury Council](https://forum.moonbeam.network/g/TreasuryCouncil){target=\_blank} oversees the spending of the Moonbeam Treasury and votes on funding proposals. It comprises two members from the Moonbeam Foundation and three external community members. The three external members are elected to terms of {{ networks.moonbeam.treasury.months_elected }} months. The same Treasury Council oversees Treasury requests for both Moonbeam and Moonriver. The Council meets monthly to review proposals submitted on the [Moonbeam Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/treasury-proposals/8){target=\_blank}. Once a proposal is agreed upon, the Council members must complete the on-chain approval process.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

Some important terminology to understand regarding treasuries:

- **Treasury Council** — a group of Moonbeam Foundation representatives and external community members. The Council reviews funding proposals, ensures alignment with the community, and ultimately authorizes Treasury spending
- **Proposal** — a plan or suggestion submitted by stakeholders to further the network to be approved by the Treasury Council

## Treasury Addresses {: #treasury-addresses }

The Treasury address for each respective network can be found below:

=== "Moonbeam"

    [0x6d6F646c70632f74727372790000000000000000](https://moonbase.subscan.io/account/0x6d6F646c70632f74727372790000000000000000){target=_blank}

## Roadmap of a Treasury Proposal {: #roadmap-of-a-treasury-proposal }

The happy path of a Treasury spend request is as follows:

1. **Proposal submission** - the user submits a proposal to the [Moonbeam Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/treasury-proposals/8){target=\_blank}

2. **Forum discussion** - the proposal is discussed by the community on the Forum. The ultimate Aye/Nay decision is determined by the Treasury council

3. **Treasury approval and action** - if the Treasury Council agrees, it authorizes the Treasury spending and moves the process forward

## Treasury Council Voting Process {: #treasury-council-voting-process }

A member of the Treasury Council will submit a `treasury.spend` call. This call requires specifying the amount, the asset type, and the beneficiary account to receive the funds. The Treasury supports spending various token types beyond GLMR, including native USDT/USDC. Once this extrinsic is submitted, a new Treasury Council collective proposal will be created and made available for council members to vote on. Once approved through the Treasury Council's internal voting process, the funds will be released automatically to the beneficiary account through the `treasury.payout` extrinsic.
 
!!! note
    There is no on-chain action for the proposer or beneficiary of the Treasury spend request.
    All Treasury spend actions will be completed by members of the Treasury Council.

Note that this process has changed significantly from prior Treasury processes, where tokenholders could submit Treasury proposals with bonds attached. Now, no on-chain action is necessary to submit a Treasury proposal. Rather, all that is needed is to raise a Treasury Council request on the [Moonbeam Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/treasury-proposals/8){target=\_blank} and the Treasury Council will take care of the on-chain components.

# Cross-Chain Communication Methods

Moonbeam makes it easy for developers to build smart contracts that connect across chains, both within the Polkadot ecosystem and outside the Polkadot ecosystem. This page will provide an overview of the underlying protocols that enable cross-chain communication and how you can leverage them to build connected contracts. For step-by-step guides of how to put these principles into practice, be sure to check out the [interoperability tutorials](/tutorials/interoperability/){target=\_blank}.

Two key terms that will come up frequently in this guide are XCM and GMP. [XCM](/builders/interoperability/xcm/){target=\_blank} refers to cross-consensus messaging, and it's Polkadot's native interoperability language that facilitates communication between Polkadot blockchains. You can read more about the [standardized XCM message format](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/interoperability/intro-to-xcm/){target=\_blank} and [How to Get Started Building with XCM](/builders/interoperability/xcm/){target=\_blank}.

[GMP](https://moonbeam.network/news/seamless-blockchain-interoperability-the-power-of-general-message-passing-gmp){target=\_blank}, or general message passing, refers to the sending and receiving of messages within decentralized blockchain networks. While XCM is a type of general message passing, GMP colloquially refers to cross-chain communication between Moonbeam and blockchains outside of Polkadot. Similarly, in this guide, XCM refers to cross-chain messaging within Polkadot, and GMP refers to cross-chain messaging between Moonbeam and other ecosystems outside of Polkadot.

## XCM Transport Methods {: #xcm-transport-methods }  

XCMP is the protocol that carries messages conforming to the XCM standard. The difference between the two is easy to remember with the added letter "P" for protocol. While XCM is the language that defines the format of the message to send, XCMP can be thought of as the pipes that enable the delivery of said messages.

XCMP is comprised of channels that enable communication between connected blockchains. When a parachain launches on Polkadot, two XCM channels are established automatically to allow for communication between the Polkadot relay chain and the parachain itself. XCM channels are omnidirectional, so two channels must be established for bidirectional communication. 

Polkadot parachains can optionally choose to establish additional XCM channels with other parachains. Establishing XCM channels with other chains is a double opt-in process, so the receiving chain must also agree to have the channel established. Establishing XCM channels with another parachain allows for the exchange of XCM messages, enabling the flow of cross-chain assets and remote contract calls, to name a few examples. 

There are several different subcategories of XCM transport methods, including:

### VMP {: #vmp } 

VMP, or [Vertical Message Passing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#vmp-vertical-message-passing){target=\_blank}, refers to message passing between the relay chain and a parachain. Given that XCM channels are one-way, there are two types of message passing that comprise VMP, namely:  

- **UMP** - Upward Message Passing refers to message passing from a parachain to the relay chain
- **DMP** - Downward Message Passing refers to message passing from the relay chain to a parachain

### HRMP {: #HRMP } 

[Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#hrmp-xcmp-lite){target=\_blank} (HRMP) is a temporary protocol that is currently being used while XCMP (Cross-Chain Message Passing) is still under development. HRMP serves as a placeholder and provides the same functionality and interface as XCMP. However, HRMP is more resource-intensive because it stores all messages within the Relay Chain's storage. 

When opening XCM channels with other parachains today, those channels are using HRMP in place of the aforementioned XCMP. Once the implementation of XCMP is complete, the plan is to phase out HRMP and replace it with XCMP gradually. For more information about each one, be sure to check out [Polkadot's Guide to XCM Transport](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/){target=\_blank}.

## General Message Passing {: #general-message-passing } 

As you know, GMP colloquially refers to cross-chain communication between Moonbeam and other blockchains outside of Polkadot. General message passing is enabled by cross-chain protocols that specialize in cross-chain communication. Each GMP provider takes a slightly different approach, but conceptually, they are quite similar. There are different contracts and functions for each provider, but each GMP provider has the same end goal: to provide secure and reliable cross-chain communication.  

### Happy Path of a Cross-Chain Message {: #happy-path-of-a-cross-chain-message } 

At a high level, the happy path of a message sent via GMP is as follows. A user or developer will call a contract specific to the GMP protocol, sometimes referred to as a mailbox contract or a gateway contract. This call typically includes parameters like the destination chain, the destination contract address, and includes sufficient value to pay for the transaction on the destination chain. A GMP provider listens for specific events on the origin blockchain pertaining to their gateway or mailbox contracts that indicate that a user wants to send a cross-chain message using their protocol. The GMP provider will validate certain parameters, including whether or not sufficient value was provided to pay for gas on the destination chain. In fact, the GMP provider may have a decentralized network of many nodes checking the authenticity of the message and verifying parameters. The GMP provider will not validate the integrity of the contract call to be delivered on the destination chain. E.g., the GMP provider will happily deliver a valid, paid-for message that contains a smart contract call that reverts on arrival. Finally, if everything checks out according to the consensus mechanism of the GMP provider, the message will be delivered to the destination chain, triggering the respective contract call at the destination.

![Happy Path of a cross chain GMP message](/images/learn/features/xchain-plans/xchain-plans-1.webp) 

### GMP Providers Integrated with Moonbeam {: #gmp-providers-integrated-with-moonbeam } 
A large number of GMP providers have integrated with Moonbeam, which is beneficial for several reasons. For one, it enables you to work with whichever GMP provider you prefer. Second, it means that Moonbeam is connected to a rapidly growing number of chains. Whenever a GMP provider integrated with Moonbeam adds support for another chain, Moonbeam is automatically now connected with that chain. GMP providers are constantly adding support for new chains, and it's exciting to see those new integrations benefit the Moonbeam community. Additionally, having a variety of GMP providers allows for redundancy and backup. GMP providers have occasional maintenance windows or downtime; thus, it may make sense to add support for multiple GMP providers to ensure consistent uptime. 

A significant number of GMP providers have integrated with Moonbeam, offering multiple benefits. Firstly, this integration allows users the flexibility to choose their preferred GMP provider. Secondly, Moonbeam's connectivity is enhanced as it automatically links with any new chains that its GMP providers support. Given that GMP providers frequently expand their support to new chains, the continuous roll out of new chains is a promising ongoing benefit for the Moonbeam community. Additionally, the diversity of GMP providers ensures better reliability and backup options. Since GMP providers can occasionally experience downtime or scheduled maintenance, the ability to integrate with multiple GMP providers is an important benefit.

The following GMP providers have integrated with Moonbeam: 

- [Axelar](/builders/interoperability/protocols/axelar/){target=\_blank}
- [Hyperlane](/builders/interoperability/protocols/hyperlane/){target=\_blank}
- [LayerZero](/builders/interoperability/protocols/layerzero/){target=\_blank} 
- [Wormhole](/builders/interoperability/protocols/wormhole/){target=\_blank}

## Implementing Both XCM and GMP {: #implementing-both-xcm-and-gmp } 

Building with XCM or GMP does not preclude building with the other. As they suit different use cases, a team may seek to utilize XCM to handle interoperability needs within Polkadot, and GMP to deliver cross-chain messages to and from blockchains outside of Polkadot. As an example, several DEXes on Moonbeam support the trading of tokens migrated to Moonbeam via XCM, such as xcDOT, and assets bridged from ecosystems outside of Polkadot, such as USDC via Wormhole. 

### Moonbeam Routed Liquidity {: #moonbeam-routed-liquidity }

[Moonbeam Routed Liquidity](/builders/interoperability/mrl/) (MRL) enables seamless liquidity between external blockchains connected to Moonbeam via Wormhole to Polkadot parachains connected to Moonbeam via XCM. This combination of GMP and XCM means that any ERC-20 token on a chain that Wormhole has integrated with can be routed through Moonbeam to a destination parachain (and back). A diagram of the happy path of a token transfer to a parachain via MRL is shown below, and you can find more information at the [MRL docs](/builders/interoperability/mrl/).

# The Moonbase Alpha TestNet

## Goal {: #goal }

The first Moonbeam TestNet, named Moonbase Alpha, aims to provide developers with a place to start experimenting and building on Moonbeam in a shared environment. Since Moonbeam is deployed as a parachain on Kusama and Polkadot, the goal of the TestNet is to reflect the production configurations. For this reason, it was decided that it needed to be a parachain-based configuration rather than a Substrate development setup.

In order to collect as much feedback as possible and provide fast issue resolution, please join the [Moonbeam Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank}.

## Initial Configuration {: #initial-configuration }

Moonbase Alpha has the following configuration:

 - Runs as a parachain connected to a relay chain
 - Has an active set of {{ networks.moonbase.staking.max_candidates }} collator nodes run by the community
 - The relay chain hosts validators to finalize relay chain blocks. One of them is selected to finalize each block collated by Moonbeam's collators. This setup provides room to expand to a two-parachain configuration in the future
 - Has infrastructure providers that provide [API endpoints](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank} to connect to the network. Projects can also [run their own node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/){target=\_blank} to have access to their own private endpoints

!!! note
    As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.
    
    Additionally, as of runtime 2900, the block and transaction gas limits increased by 4x on Moonbase Alpha.

## Network Endpoints {: #network-endpoints }

Moonbase Alpha has two types of endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

If you're looking for your own endpoints suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. Otherwise, to get started quickly you can use one of the following public HTTPS or WSS endpoints.

=== "HTTPS"
    |      Provider       |                              RPC URL                               |   Limits    |

    |     OnFinality      |  <pre>```https://moonbeam-alpha.api.onfinality.io/public```</pre>  | 40 req/sec  |
    | Moonbeam Foundation |     <pre>```https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre>     | 25 req/sec  |
    |     UnitedBloc      |          <pre>```https://moonbase.unitedbloc.com```</pre>          | 32 req/sec  |
    |     RadiumBlock     | <pre>```https://moonbase.public.curie.radiumblock.co/http```</pre> | 200 req/sec |

=== "WSS"
    |      Provider       |                              RPC URL                              |   Limits    |
    |:-------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
    |       Dwellir       |          <pre>```wss://moonbase-rpc.dwellir.com```</pre>          | 20 req/sec  |
    |     OnFinality      | <pre>```wss://moonbeam-alpha.api.onfinality.io/public-ws```</pre> | 40 req/sec  |
    | Moonbeam Foundation |     <pre>```wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre>      | 25 req/sec  |
    |     UnitedBloc      |          <pre>```wss://moonbase.unitedbloc.com```</pre>           | 32 req/sec  |
    |     RadiumBlock     |  <pre>```wss://moonbase.public.curie.radiumblock.co/ws```</pre>   | 200 req/sec |


#### Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

To connect to the Moonbase Alpha relay chain, you can use the following WS Endpoint:

| Provider |                          RPC URL                           |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| OpsLayer | <pre>```wss://relay.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre> |

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

For the [Web3.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}, you can create a local Web3 instance and set the provider to connect to Moonbase Alpha (both HTTP and WS are supported):

```js
const { Web3 } = require('web3'); // Load Web3 library
.
.
.
// Create local Web3 instance - set Moonbase Alpha as provider
const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network'); 
```

For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonbase Alpha:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network';
// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1287,
    name: 'moonbase-alphanet'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonbase Alpha TestNet chain ID is: `1287`, which is `0x507` in hex.

## Alphanet Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

The Alphanet relay chain is connected to Moonbase Alpha and is [Westend](https://polkadot.com/blog/westend-introducing-a-new-testnet-for-polkadot-and-kusama){target=\_blank}-based but unique to the Moonbeam ecosystem. It resembles how you would interact with Kusama or Polkadot. The native tokens of the Alphanet relay chain are UNIT tokens, which are for testing purposes only and have no real value.

## Telemetry {: #telemetry }

You can see current Moonbase Alpha telemetry information by visiting [Polkadot's Telemetry dashboard](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/0x91bc6e169807aaa54802737e1c504b2577d4fafedd5a02c10293b1cd60e39527){target=\_blank}.

## Tokens {: #tokens }

Tokens on Moonbase Alpha, named DEV, will be issued on demand. **DEV tokens hold no value and can be freely acquired**.

You can enter your address to automatically request DEV tokens from the [Moonbase Alpha Faucet](https://faucet.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} website. The faucet dispenses {{ networks.moonbase.website_faucet_amount }} every 24 hours.

For token requests of more than the limited amount allowed by the faucet, contact a moderator directly via the [Moonbeam Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank}. We are happy to provide the tokens needed to test your applications.

## Proof of Stake {: #proof-of-stake }

The Moonbase Alpha TestNet is a fully decentralized Delegated Proof of Stake network where users of the network can delegate collator candidates to produce blocks and "earn rewards" for testing purposes. Please note, that the Moonbase Alpha DEV tokens have no real value. The number of candidates in the active set will be subject to governance. The active set will consist of the top candidates by stake, including delegations.

## Limitations {: #limitations }

This is the first TestNet for Moonbeam, so there are some limitations.

Some [precompiles](https://www.evm.codes/precompiled){target=\_blank} are yet to be included. You can check out the list of supported precompiles on the [Canonical Contract page](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/){target=\_blank}. However, all built-in functions are available.

Since the release of Moonbase Alpha v6, the maximum gas limit per block has been set to {{ networks.moonbase.gas_block }}, with a maximum gas limit per transaction of {{ networks.moonbase.gas_tx }}.

# Moonbeam

## Goal {: #goal }

Moonbeam was onboarded as a parachain to Polkadot on December 17th 2021. Moonbeam is the most Ethereum compatible smart-contract parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem. It allows developers to port their projects with minimal to no code changes, enabling them to tap into the Polkadot ecosystem and all its assets.

In order to collect as much feedback as possible and provide fast issue resolution, you can check out the dedicated [Moonbeam Network section on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank}.

## Initial Configurations {: #initial-configurations }

Currently, Moonbeam has the following configurations:

- Runs as a parachain connected to the Polkadot relay chain
- Has an active set of {{ networks.moonbeam.staking.max_candidates }} collators
- Has infrastructure providers that provide [API endpoints](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank} to connect to the network. Projects can also [run their own node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/){target=\_blank} to have access to their own private endpoints

## Network Endpoints {: #network-endpoints }

Moonbeam has two types of endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

If you're looking for your own endpoints suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. Otherwise, to get started quickly you can use one of the following public HTTPS or WSS endpoints:

=== "HTTPS"
    |  Provider   |                              RPC URL                               |   Limits    |
    |:-----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
    |   Dwellir   |         <pre>```https://moonbeam-rpc.dwellir.com```</pre>          | 20 req/sec  |
    | OnFinality  |     <pre>```https://moonbeam.api.onfinality.io/public```</pre>     | 40 req/sec  |
    | UnitedBloc  |          <pre>```https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com```</pre>          | 32 req/sec  |
    | RadiumBlock | <pre>```https://moonbeam.public.curie.radiumblock.co/http```</pre> | 200 req/sec |
    |    1RPC     |               <pre>```https://1rpc.io/glmr```</pre>                | 10k req/day |

=== "WSS"
    |  Provider   |                            RPC URL                             |   Limits    |
    |:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
    |   Dwellir   |        <pre>```wss://moonbeam-rpc.dwellir.com```</pre>         | 20 req/sec  |
    | OnFinality  |  <pre>```wss://moonbeam.api.onfinality.io/public-ws```</pre>   | 40 req/sec  |

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

Before getting started, make sure you've retrieved your own endpoint and API key from one of the custom [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}. Then for the [Web3.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}, you can create a local Web3 instance and set the provider to connect to Moonbeam (both HTTP and WS are supported):

```js
const { Web3 } = require('web3'); // Load Web3 library
.
.
.
// Create local Web3 instance - set Moonbeam as provider
const web3 = new Web3('INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT'); // Insert your RPC URL here
```

For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonbeam:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT'; // Insert your RPC URL here

// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1284,
    name: 'moonbeam'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonbeam chain ID is: `1284`, or `0x504` in hex.

## Telemetry {: #telemetry }

You can see current Moonbeam telemetry information by visiting [Polkadot's Telemetry dashboard](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/0xfe58ea77779b7abda7da4ec526d14db9b1e9cd40a217c34892af80a9b332b76d){target=\_blank}.

## Tokens {: #tokens }

The tokens on Moonbeam are called Glimmer (GLMR). Check out the Moonbeam Foundation site for more information on the [Glimmer](https://moonbeam.foundation/glimmer-token-tokenomics){target=\_blank} token.

### Token Denominations {: #token-denominations }

The smallest unit of Glimmer (GMLR), similarly to Ethereum, is a Wei. It takes 10^18 Wei to make one Glimmer. The denominations are as follows:

|   Unit    |    Glimmer (GLMR)    |              Wei              |
|:---------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|    Wei    | 0.000000000000000001 |               1               |
|  Kilowei  |  0.000000000000001   |             1,000             |
|  Megawei  |    0.000000000001    |           1,000,000           |
|  Gigawei  |     0.000000001      |         1,000,000,000         |
| Microglmr |       0.000001       |       1,000,000,000,000       |
| Milliglmr |        0.001         |     1,000,000,000,000,000     |
|   GLMR    |          1           |   1,000,000,000,000,000,000   |
| Kiloglmr  |        1,000         | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 |

## Proof of Stake {: #proof-of-stake }

The Moonriver network is a fully decentralized Delegated Proof of Stake network where users of the network can delegate collator candidates to produce blocks and earn rewards. It uses the [Nimbus framework](/learn/features/consensus/){target=\_blank} framework for parachain consensus. The number of candidates in the active set will be subject to governance. The active set will consist of the top candidates by stake, including delegations.

## Limitations {: #limitations }

Some [precompiles](https://www.evm.codes/precompiled){target=\_blank} are yet to be included. You can check a list of supported precompiles on the [Solidity Precompiles page](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/overview/){target=\_blank}. However, all built-in functions are available.

# Moonriver

## Goal {: #goal }

In June 2021, Moonriver was first launched as a parachain on the Kusama network. Moonriver is a sister network of Moonbeam, and provides an environment to test new code under real economic conditions. Developers now have access to start building on an incentivized canary network connected to Kusama.

In order to collect as much feedback as possible and provide fast issue resolution, you can check out the dedicated [Moonriver section on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5TaUvbRvgM){target=\_blank}.

## Initial Configurations {: #initial-configurations }

Currently, Moonriver has the following configurations:

- Runs as a parachain connected to the Kusama relay chain
- Has an active set of {{ networks.moonriver.staking.max_candidates }} collators
- Has infrastructure providers that provide [API endpoints](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank} to connect to the network. Projects can also [run their own node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/){target=\_blank} to have access to their own private endpoints

!!! note
    As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.

    Additionally, the block and transaction gas limits increased by 4x on Moonriver.

# Networks

There are multiple long-lived Moonbeam-based networks. Most significantly, there is the Moonbeam deployment on Polkadot and Kusama.

An overview of our parachain deployments is as follows:

 - Moonbeam: deployment on Polkadot (_December 2021_)
 - Moonriver: deployment on Kusama (_June 2021_)
 - Moonbase Alpha: Parachain TestNet for Moonbeam and Moonriver (_September 2020_)

This strategy allows us to de-risk software upgrades to Moonbeam on the Polkadot MainNet while still maintaining a reasonable update velocity.

## Moonbeam {: #moonbeam }

The Moonbeam production MainNet is a parachain on Polkadot and has been since December 17th, 2021. Moonbeam features the highest levels of security and availability. Code running on the MainNet has generally been vetted through one or more of the other networks listed above.

Moonbeam will offer parachain-related functionalities such as [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#xcmp-cross-chain-message-passing){target=\_blank} and [SPREE](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-spree/){target=\_blank} as these features become available.

[Learn more about Moonbeam](/learn/platform/networks/moonbeam/).

## Moonriver {: #moonriver }

In advance of deploying to the Polkadot MainNet, [Moonbeam launched Moonriver](https://moonbeam.network/news/moonriver-won-a-parachain-slot-and-is-now-producing-blocks-on-the-kusama-network){target=\_blank} as a parachain on the Kusama network. The parachain functionality is live on Kusama.

Moonriver will offer parachain-related functionalities such as [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm-transport/#xcmp-cross-chain-message-passing){target=\_blank} and [SPREE](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-spree/){target=\_blank} as these features become available.

[Learn more about Moonriver](/learn/platform/networks/moonriver/).

## Moonbase Alpha {: #moonbase-alpha }

This TestNet is a network hosted by OpsLayer. It features a parachain/relay chain scheme. The goal is to allow developers to test the Ethereum compatibility features of Moonbeam in a shared parachain environment without needing to run their own nodes or network.

title: Technology & Architecture
description: Moonbeam is built using Rust and Polkadot's Substrate framework, enabling rich tools for implementation while allowing for specialization and optimization.
categories: Basics
---

# Technology & Architecture

## The Moonbeam Development Stack {: #the-moonbeam-development-stack }

Moonbeam is a smart contract blockchain platform built in the Rust programming language using the Substrate framework. Substrate, developed by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/){target=_blank} (the original founding contributors of Polkadot), is an open-source, modular SDK for creating blockchains. Substrate allows developers to customize their blockchains while still benefiting from features such as forkless upgrades, shared security (when connected as a parachain to Polkadot or Kusama), and an extensive library of pre-built runtime modules known as pallets.

### Rust Programming Language {: #rust-programming-language }

Rust is a good language for implementing a blockchain. It is highly performant like C and C++ but has built-in memory safety features enforced at compile time, preventing many common bugs and security issues arising from C and C++ implementations.

### Substrate Framework {: #substrate-framework }

Substrate provides a rich set of tools for creating blockchains, including a runtime execution environment that enables a generic state transition function and a pluggable set of modules (pallets) that implement various blockchain subsystems. By using Substrate, Moonbeam can leverage several key features offered to parachains launched on the Polkadot relay chain, including:

- **Shared security** — Polkadot's validators secure all parachains  
- **Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)** — native interoperability with other parachains  
- **Flexible upgrades** — Substrate’s forkless upgrade mechanism

Pallets are at the heart of Substrate-based chains, providing specific functionality in modular form. Examples include:

- **Balances pallet** — manages account balances and transfers  
- **Assets pallet** — handles the creation and management of on-chain fungible assets  
- **Consensus pallets** — provide mechanisms like AURA or BABE for block production  
- **Governance pallets** — facilitate on-chain governance  
- **Frontier pallets** — the Ethereum compatibility layer pioneered by the Moonbeam team  
- **Parachain Staking pallet** — enables Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)  

In addition to these pallets provided by Polkadot's Substrate, developers can [create their own pallets](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/make-custom-pallet/){target=_blank} to add custom functionality. Moonbeam leverages multiple existing Substrate frame pallets as well as several custom pallets for features such as cross-chain token integration, the [Orbiter Program](/node-operators/networks/collators/orbiter/){target=_blank}, and more. You can find the Moonbeam runtime (built using Substrate) and related pallets in the [Moonbeam GitHub repository](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam){target=_blank}.

Moonbeam also uses the Cumulus library to facilitate integration with the Polkadot relay chain.

### Frontier: Substrate's Ethereum Compatibility Layer {: #frontier }

[Frontier](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier){target=\_blank} serves as Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer, facilitating the seamless operation of standard Ethereum DApps on Substrate-based chains without requiring modifications. This compatibility is achieved by integrating specialized Substrate pallets into the Substrate runtime. These pallets include:

- **EVM pallet** — responsible for executing EVM operations  
- **Ethereum pallet** — manages block data storage and offers RPC compatibility  
- **Base Fee pallet and Dynamic Fee pallet** — provide EIP-1559 functionality (not used in Moonbeam)

Moonbeam uses the EVM and Ethereum pallets to achieve full Ethereum compatibility. Instead of the Base Fee or Dynamic Fee pallets, Moonbeam has its own [dynamic fee mechanism](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-dynamic-fee-mechanism-for-moonbeam-and-moonriver/241){target=\_blank} for base fee calculations. Basing the EVM implementation on the Substrate EVM Pallet provides a Rust-based EVM engine and support from the Parity engineering team.

## Blockchain Runtime {: #blockchain-runtime }

The core Moonbeam runtime specifies the state transition function and behavior of the Moonbeam blockchain. The runtime is built using [FRAME](/learn/platform/glossary/#substrate-frame-pallets){target=\_blank}, compiled to a [WebAssembly (Wasm)](/learn/platform/glossary/#webassemblywasm){target=\_blank} binary as well as a native binary. These compiled versions are executed in the Polkadot relay chain and Moonbeam node environments.

!!! note
    Substrate FRAME pallets are a collection of Rust-based modules that provide the functionality required when building a blockchain. WebAssembly is an open standard that defines a portable binary code format. Different programming languages, compilers, and browsers support it. Find more definitions [in our glossary](/learn/platform/glossary/){target=\_blank}.

Some of the key Substrate FRAME pallets used in the Moonbeam runtime include:

 - **Balances** — support for accounts, balances, and transfers  
 - **EVM** — a full Rust-based EVM implementation based on SputnikVM (part of Frontier)  
 - **Ethereum** — provides emulation of Ethereum block processing for the EVM (part of Frontier)  
 - **Executive** — orchestration layer that dispatches calls to other runtime modules  
 - **Identity** — support for setting on-chain identities for account addresses  
 - **System** — provides low-level types, storage, and blockchain functions  
 - **Treasury** — on-chain treasury that can be used to fund public goods such as a parachain slot  

In addition to these Substrate FRAME Pallets, Moonbeam implements custom pallets to achieve additional functionality, such as:

- **Parachain Staking** — enables a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) system  
- **Moonbeam Orbiters** — supports the [Orbiter Program](/node-operators/networks/collators/orbiter/){target=\_blank}, which diversifies the collator pool  
- **XCM Transactor** — simplifies remote cross-chain calls via [Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)](/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/){target=\_blank}  
- **Asset Manager** — registers XCM assets  

### Forkless Upgrades {: #forkless-upgrades }

One of the best things about developing on Polkadot with Substrate is the ability to introduce [forkless upgrades](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/maintenance/runtime-upgrades/){target=_blank} to blockchain runtimes. In traditional blockchain architectures, substantial changes to the blockchain's rules often require a hard fork, which can be disruptive and contentious.  

Substrate takes a different approach by separating the blockchain's state (data) from its logic (rules). Logic lives in the runtime, which is itself stored on-chain. Whenever a new runtime is uploaded (via FRAME's `set_code` call) and approved through on-chain governance, all nodes automatically switch to the new runtime at a specified block. This process is seamless and does not split the network.  

Moonbeam regularly uses forkless upgrades to add features or fixes without requiring node operators to upgrade their software manually. You can keep track of and discuss upcoming Moonbeam upgrades on the [Moonbeam forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network){target=_blank}.

## Ethereum Compatibility Architecture {: #ethereum-compatibility-architecture }

Smart contracts on Moonbeam can be implemented using Solidity, Vyper, and any other language that compiles smart contracts to EVM-compatible bytecode. Moonbeam aims to provide a low-friction and secure environment for the development, testing, and execution of smart contracts while remaining compatible with the existing Ethereum developer toolchain.

The execution behavior and semantics of Moonbeam-based smart contracts strive to be as close as possible to Ethereum Layer 1. Moonbeam is a single shard, so cross-contract calls have the same synchronous execution semantics as on Ethereum Layer 1.

![Diagram showing the interactions made possible through Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility](/images/learn/platform/technology-diagram.webp)

A high-level interaction flow is shown above. A Web3 RPC call from a DApp or existing Ethereum developer tool, such as Hardhat, is received by a Moonbeam node. The node has both Web3 RPCs and Substrate RPCs available, meaning you can use Ethereum or Substrate tools when interacting with a Moonbeam node. Associated Substrate runtime functions handle these RPC calls. The Substrate runtime checks signatures and handles any extrinsics. Smart contract calls are ultimately passed to the EVM to execute the state transitions.

### Ethereum Pallet {: #ethereum-pallet}

The [Ethereum pallet](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/overview){target=\_blank} is responsible for handling blocks and transaction receipts and statuses. It enables sending and receiving Ethereum-formatted data to and from Moonbeam by storing an Ethereum-style block and its associated transaction hashes in the Substrate runtime.

When a user submits a raw Ethereum transaction, it converts into a Substrate transaction through the Ethereum pallet's `transact` extrinsic—using the Ethereum pallet as the sole executor of the EVM pallet forces all of the data to be stored and transacted in an Ethereum-compatible way, which is how explorers like [Moonscan](/builders/get-started/explorers/#moonscan){target=\_blank} (built by Etherscan) can index block data.

### EVM Pallet {: #evm-pallet }

The [EVM pallet](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/overview){target=\_blank} implements a sandboxed virtual stack machine and uses the [SputnikVM](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm){target=\_blank} as the underlying EVM engine. It executes Ethereum smart contract bytecode in a manner similar to Ethereum mainnet, including gas metering and state changes.

Moonbeam uses unified accounts, meaning an H160 (Ethereum-style) address is also a valid Substrate address, so you only need a single account to interact with the Substrate runtime and the EVM. Once a balance exists in the EVM, smart contracts can be created and interacted with through standard Ethereum RPC calls.  

The EVM pallet should produce nearly identical execution results to Ethereum, such as gas cost and balance changes. However, there are some differences. Although the EVM pallet aims for near-identical behavior to Ethereum, some differences exist, for example, Moonbeam's [dynamic fee mechanism](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-dynamic-fee-mechanism-for-moonbeam-and-moonriver/241){target=\_blank}. For more information, refer to the [Frontier EVM Pallet documentation](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/){target=\_blank}.

Moonbeam includes additional EVM precompiles for functionalities like cryptographic operations (ECRecover, SHA256, BLAKE2, BN128) and dispatching Substrate calls directly from within the EVM. Moonbeam uses the following EVM precompiles:

- **[pallet-evm-precompile-simple](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm_precompile_simple){target=\_blank}** - includes five basic precompiles: ECRecover, ECRecoverPublicKey, Identity, RIPEMD160, SHA256
- **[pallet-evm-precompile-blake2](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm_precompile_blake2/struct.Blake2F.html){target=\_blank}** - includes the BLAKE2 precompile
- **[pallet-evm-precompile-bn128](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm_precompile_bn128/index.html){target=\_blank}** - includes three BN128 precompiles: BN128Add, BN128Mul, and BN128Pairing
- **[pallet-evm-precompile-modexp](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm_precompile_modexp/struct.Modexp.html){target=\_blank}** - includes the modular exponentiation precompile
- **[pallet-evm-precompile-sha3fips](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm_precompile_sha3fips/struct.Sha3FIPS256.html){target=\_blank}** -includes the standard SHA3 precompile
- **[pallet-evm-precompile-dispatch](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm_precompile_dispatch/struct.Dispatch.html){target=\_blank}** - includes the dispatch precompile

You can find an overview of most of these precompiles on the [Ethereum MainNet Precompiled Contracts](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/utility/eth-mainnet/){target=\_blank} page.

## Native Interoperability {: #native-interoperability }

While Substrate allows developers to create blockchains, one of its most significant advantages is that it supports integration for native interoperability through relay chains like Polkadot and Kusama.  

A relay chain is a central chain that connects several blockchains, known as parachains. Each parachain is a distinct blockchain with its runtime and state, but all are connected to and secured by the relay chain. Once connected, parachains can communicate via [Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)](/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/){target=_blank} to exchange information and conduct transactions in the same language, enabling a wide range of interoperable applications.  

Moonbeam and Moonriver have established XCM connections with a large number of parachains. You can see a visualization of all XCM integrations in this [XCM Channel Viewer](https://dotsama-channels.vercel.app/#/){target=_blank}.

# Introduction

As a decentralized smart contract platform, Moonbeam requires a utility token to function.  

This token is central to the design of Moonbeam and cannot be removed without sacrificing essential functionality. The Moonbeam token uses include:

 - Supporting the gas metering of smart contract execution
 - Incentivizing collators and powering the mechanics around the creation of a decentralized node infrastructure on which the platform can run
 - Facilitating the on-chain governance mechanism, including proposing referenda, electing council members, voting, etc.
 - Paying for network transaction fees

## Glimmer Token {: #glimmer-token }

In the Moonbeam deployment on Polkadot MainNet, this token is called Glimmer, as in, “that smart contract call will cost 0.3 Glimmer.”  The token symbol is GLMR.

You can find more information about Glimmer on the [Moonbeam Foundation](https://moonbeam.foundation/glimmer-token-tokenomics) website.

## Moonriver Token {: #moonriver-token }

In the Moonbeam deployment on Kusama (called Moonriver), this token is called Moonriver, as in, “that smart contract call will cost 0.003 Moonriver.”  The token symbol will be MOVR.

You can find more information about Moonriver on the [Moonbeam Foundation](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonriver-token-tokenomics) website.

## DEV Token {: #dev-token }

In the Moonbeam TestNet (called Moonbase Alpha), the token is called DEV. This token can be acquired freely, as its only purpose is to drive development and testing on Moonbase Alpha.

You can get DEV tokens for testing on Moonbase Alpha once every 24 hours from the [Moonbase Alpha Faucet](https://faucet.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}.

title: The Moonbeam Vision | Multi-chain
description: Moonbeam is designed to enable a multi-chain future, where users and assets can move freely across many specialized and heterogeneous chains.
categories: Basics

# Our Vision for Moonbeam

We believe in a multi-chain future with many chains, and many users and assets on those chains. In this context, we have created Moonbeam: a smart contract platform that provides an Ethereum-compatible environment for building decentralized applications. Moonbeam was designed to serve these new kinds of assets and users that exist across two or more chains.

Existing smart contract platforms are designed to service the users and assets on a single, specific chain.  By providing cross-chain smart contract functionality, Moonbeam allows developers to shift existing workloads and logic to Moonbeam and extend the reach of their applications to new users and assets on other chains.

Moonbeam's cross-chain integration is accomplished by becoming a [parachain](/learn/platform/glossary/#parachains) on the Polkadot network.  The [Polkadot network](/learn/platform/glossary/#polkadot) provides integration and connectivity between parachains that are connected to the network and to other non-Polkadot-based chains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, via bridges.

## Who Benefits From Moonbeam {: #who-benefits-from-moonbeam }

There are three main audiences who can most benefit from Moonbeam's cross-chain functionality:

### Existing Ethereum-Based Projects {: #existing-ethereum-based-projects }

Projects that are struggling with cost and scalability challenges on Ethereum can use Moonbeam to:

 - Move portions of their existing workloads and state off of Ethereum Layer 1 with minimal required changes.  
 - Implement a hybrid approach, where applications live on both Ethereum and Moonbeam simultaneously.  
 - Extend their reach to the Polkadot network and other chains that are connected to Polkadot.  

### Polkadot Ecosystem Projects {: #polkadot-ecosystem-projects }

Ecosystem projects that need smart contract functionality can use Moonbeam to:  

 - Augment their existing parachains and parathreads.  
 - Add new functionality that is needed but not included on the main [Polkadot relay chain](/learn/platform/glossary/#relay-chain). For example, they could create a place where teams can crowdfund their projects, implement lockdrops, and process other, more complex financial transactions than are provided by base [Substrate](/learn/platform/glossary/#substrate) functionality.  
 - Leverage the mature and extensive Ethereum development toolchain.  

### Developers of New DApps {: #developers-of-new-dapps }

Individuals and teams that want to try building on Polkadot can use Moonbeam to:

 - Leverage the specialized functionality from Polkadot parachains while reaching users and assets on other chains.  
 - Compose functionality from Polkadot parachains by using Moonbeam as a lightweight integration layer that aggregates network services before presenting them to end users. Implementing a composed service using pre-built integrations on a smart contract platform will be a lot faster and easier (in many cases) than building a full Substrate runtime and performing the integrations yourself in the runtime.  

## Key Features and Functionality {: #key-features-and-functionality }

Moonbeam achieves these goals with the following key features:  

 - **Decentralized and Permissionless** , providing a base requirement for censorship resistance and support for many existing and future DApp use cases.  
 - **Contains a Full EVM Implementation** , enabling Solidity-based smart contracts to be migrated with minimal change and with expected execution results.  
 - **Implements the Web3 RPC API** so that existing DApp front-ends can be migrated with minimal change required, and so existing Ethereum-based tools, such as Hardhat, Remix, and MetaMask, can be used without modification against Moonbeam.  
 - **Compatible with the Substrate Ecosystem Toolset** , including block explorers, front-end development libraries, and wallets, allowing developers and users to use the right tool for what they are trying to accomplish.  
 - **Native Cross-Chain Integration** via the Polkadot network and via token bridges, which allows for token movement, state visibility, and message passing with Ethereum and other chains.  
 - **On-Chain Governance** to allow stakeholders to quickly and forklessly evolve the base protocol according to developer and community needs.  

This unique combination of elements fills a strategic market gap, while allowing Moonbeam to address future developer needs as the Polkadot network grows over time.  Building your own chain with Substrate is powerful, but also comes with a number of additional responsibilities, such as learning and implementing the chain’s runtime in Rust, creating a token economy, and incentivizing a community of node operators.

For many developers and projects, an Ethereum-compatible smart contract approach will be much simpler and faster to implement.  And by building these smart contracts on Moonbeam, developers can still integrate with other chains and get value from Polkadot-based network effects.

title: Why Polkadot
description: Moonbeam is built on the Substrate framework and connected to the Polkadot network, adding speed and security to the platform.

# Why We're Building on Polkadot

After extensive research, we decided to build Moonbeam using the [Substrate development framework](/learn/platform/glossary/#substrate) and to deploy Moonbeam as a [parachain](/learn/platform/glossary/#parachains) on the [Polkadot network](/learn/platform/glossary/#polkadot).

## Substrate Blockchain Framework {: #substrate-blockchain-framework }

Substrate is a good technical fit for Moonbeam. By building on top of this framework, we can leverage the extensive functionality that Substrate includes out-of-the-box, rather than building it ourselves. This includes peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, governance functionality, an EVM implementation, and more.

Overall, using Substrate will dramatically reduce the time and implementation effort needed to implement Moonbeam. Substrate allows a great degree of customization, which is necessary in order to achieve our Ethereum compatibility goals. And, by using Rust, we benefit from both safety guarantees and performance gains.

## Polkadot Network and Ecosystem {: #polkadot-network-and-ecosystem }

The Polkadot network is also a good fit for Moonbeam. As a parachain on Polkadot, Moonbeam will be able to directly integrate with — and move tokens between — any other parachains and parathreads on the network.

We can also leverage any of the bridges that are independently built to connect non-Polkadot chains to Polkadot, including bridges to Ethereum. Polkadot’s interoperability model uniquely supports Moonbeam’s cross-chain integration goals and is a key enabling technology to support the Moonbeam vision.

But perhaps just as important as the technical criteria above, we are impressed with the people in the Polkadot ecosystem. This includes individuals at Parity, the Web3 Foundation, and other projects in the ecosystem. We have built many valuable relationships and find the people to be both extremely talented and the kind of people we want to be around.

# Overview of the Precompiled Contracts on Moonbeam

## Overview {: #introduction }

On Moonbeam, a precompiled contract is native Substrate code that has an Ethereum-style address and can be called using the Ethereum API, like any other smart contract. The precompiles allow you to call the Substrate runtime directly which is not normally accessible from the Ethereum side of Moonbeam.

The Substrate code responsible for implementing precompiles can be found in the [EVM pallet](/learn/platform/technology/#evm-pallet){target=\_blank}. The EVM pallet includes the [standard precompiles found on Ethereum and some additional precompiles that are not specific to Ethereum](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm/precompile){target=\_blank}. It also provides the ability to create and execute custom precompiles through the generic [`Precompiles` trait](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/trait.Precompile.html){target=\_blank}. There are several custom Moonbeam-specific precompiles that have been created, all of which can be found in the [Moonbeam codebase](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/tree/master/precompiles){target=\_blank}. It is important to highlight that the precompiles from this list with the `CallableByContract` check are not callable inside the contract constructor.

The Ethereum precompiled contracts contain complex functionality that is computationally intensive, such as hashing and encryption. The custom precompiled contracts on Moonbeam provide access to Substrate-based functionality such as staking, governance, XCM-related functions, and more.

The Moonbeam-specific precompiles can be interacted with through familiar and easy-to-use Solidity interfaces using the Ethereum API, which are ultimately used to interact with the underlying Substrate interface. This flow is depicted in the following diagram:

![Precompiled Contracts Diagram](/images/builders/ethereum/precompiles/overview/overview-1.webp)

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam. Please refer to the [Security Considerations](/learn/core-concepts/security/){target=\_blank} page for more information.

## Precompiled Contract Addresses {: #precompiled-contract-addresses }

The precompiled contracts are categorized by address and based on the origin network. If you were to convert the precompiled addresses to decimal format, and break them into categories by numeric value, the categories are as follows:

- **0-1023** - [Ethereum MainNet precompiles](#ethereum-mainnet-precompiles)
- **1024-2047** - precompiles that are [not in Ethereum and not Moonbeam specific](#non-moonbeam-specific-nor-ethereum-precomiles)
- **2048-4095** - [Moonbeam specific precompiles](#moonbeam-specific-precompiles)

# Create an Account

## Introduction {: #introduction }

To get started developing on Moonbeam, developers must create an account. The most prevalent approach involves leveraging a wallet application, which facilitates generating and managing cryptographic keys essential for interacting with Moonbeam.

Moonbeam uses H160 Ethereum-style accounts and ECDSA keys, represented in 20-byte addresses. If you already have an Ethereum account and its private key or mnemonic, you can use your account on Moonbeam.

This guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of creating an account on Moonbeam. Whether you're new to blockchain technology or an experienced Ethereum user, this guide will provide all the information you need to get started.

!!! note
    This guide does not pertain to a local Moonbeam development node. If you are using a development node, you don't need to worry about creating an account, as the node comes with ten pre-funded accounts for testing purposes. Please refer to the [Getting Started with a Local Moonbeam Development Node](/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam-dev/){target=\_blank} guide for more information.

## Choose a Wallet {: #choose-a-wallet }

A wallet is a software or hardware tool that allows you to securely store, manage, and interact with your digital assets, such as tokens or coins. Wallets store your private keys, which are essential for authorizing transactions on the network.

You can review a list of wallets on the [Moonbeam DApp Directory](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam/app-dir?cat=wallets){target=\_blank}.

![View list of wallets on the Moonbeam DApp](/images/builders/get-started/create-account/create-account-1.webp)

The list of wallets on the dApp is not exhaustive and may only cover some of the available options. You should be able to use any Ethereum-compatible wallet to generate an address and its associated private key.

You can also check out any of the wallets in the [Connect to Moonbeam](/tokens/connect/){target=\_blank} section of the docs.

## Use Your Wallet to Create an Account {: #use-your-wallet-to-create-an-account }

After you've selected a wallet and downloaded it, you'll most likely be prompted to create a new account or import an existing one the first time you open it. You'll want to create a new account.

Depending on the wallet, when creating an account, you may be prompted to backup and restore a seed phrase, also referred to as a mnemonic or recovery phrase. This phrase is a sequence of generated words that serve as a backup mechanism for private keys. They typically consist of 12 to 24 words randomly selected from a predefined list. Seed phrases are used to derive private keys deterministically, meaning that the same sequence of words will always generate the same set of private keys. They are crucial for recovering access to a cryptocurrency wallet in case of loss or device failure. **Make sure you save the phrase in a safe place; if you lose access to this phrase, you'll lose access to any funds you hold in your account.**

After saving your seed phrase, you can start developing on Moonbeam. Many wallets offer the option to export the private key linked to your account. By doing so, you can utilize your private key instead of the seed phrase during development. However, taking adequate precautions to securely store your private key or seed phrase while developing is essential.

And that's it! Before sending your first transaction on a Moonbeam-based network, ensure you have the necessary [network configurations for your chosen network](/builders/get-started/networks/){target=\_blank} and an [RPC endpoint](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank} for the network. Once you have these items, you'll be able to follow along with tutorials like the [How to use Ethers.js](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank} or the [How to use Web3.js](/builders/ethereum/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank} to send a transaction.

# Block Explorers

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Block explorers can be thought of as search engines for the blockchain. They allow users to search for information such as balances, contracts, and transactions. More advanced block explorers even offer indexing capabilities, which enable them to provide a complete set of information, such as ERC-20 tokens in the network. They might even offer API services to access it via external services.

Moonbeam provides two different kinds of explorers: ones to query the Ethereum API and others  dedicated to the Substrate API. All EVM-based transactions are accessible via the Ethereum API, while the Substrate API can be relied upon for Substrate-native functions such as governance and staking. The Substrate API also includes information about the EVM-based transactions, but only limited information is shown.

# Get Started with Moonbase Alpha

## Network Endpoints {: #network-endpoints }

Moonbase Alpha has two types of endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

If you're looking for your own endpoints suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. Otherwise, to get started quickly you can use one of the following public HTTPS or WSS endpoints.

=== "HTTPS"
    |      Provider       |                              RPC URL                               |   Limits    |
    |:-------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
    |       Dwellir       |         <pre>```https://moonbase-rpc.dwellir.com```</pre>          | 20 req/sec  |
    |     OnFinality      |  <pre>```https://moonbeam-alpha.api.onfinality.io/public```</pre>  | 40 req/sec  |
    | Moonbeam Foundation |     <pre>```https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre>     | 25 req/sec  |
    |     UnitedBloc      |          <pre>```https://moonbase.unitedbloc.com```</pre>          | 32 req/sec  |
    |     RadiumBlock     | <pre>```https://moonbase.public.curie.radiumblock.co/http```</pre> | 200 req/sec |

=== "WSS"
    |      Provider       |                              RPC URL                              |   Limits    |
    |:-------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
    |       Dwellir       |          <pre>```wss://moonbase-rpc.dwellir.com```</pre>          | 20 req/sec  |
    |     OnFinality      | <pre>```wss://moonbeam-alpha.api.onfinality.io/public-ws```</pre> | 40 req/sec  |
    | Moonbeam Foundation |     <pre>```wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre>      | 25 req/sec  |
    |     UnitedBloc      |          <pre>```wss://moonbase.unitedbloc.com```</pre>           | 32 req/sec  |
    |     RadiumBlock     |  <pre>```wss://moonbase.public.curie.radiumblock.co/ws```</pre>   | 200 req/sec |


#### Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

To connect to the Moonbase Alpha relay chain, you can use the following WS Endpoint:

| Provider |                          RPC URL                           |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| OpsLayer | <pre>```wss://relay.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre> |

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

For the [Web3.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}, you can create a local Web3 instance and set the provider to connect to Moonbase Alpha (both HTTP and WS are supported):

```js
const { Web3 } = require('web3'); // Load Web3 library
.
.
.
// Create local Web3 instance - set Moonbase Alpha as provider
const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network'); 
```

For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonbase Alpha:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network';
// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1287,
    name: 'moonbase-alphanet'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonbase Alpha TestNet chain ID is: `1287`, which is `0x507` in hex.

## Block Explorers

For Moonbase Alpha, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonbase.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=MoonbaseAlpha){target=\_blank}
 - **Substrate API** — [Subscan](https://moonbase.subscan.io){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}

For more information on each of the available block explorers, please head to the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation.

### MoonGas {: #moongas }

[MoonGas](https://moonbeam-gasinfo.netlify.app){target=\_blank} is a convenient dashboard for viewing the minimum, maximum, and average gas price of transactions in the prior block across all Moonbeam networks. Note, these statistics can fluctuate widely by block and occasionally include outlier values. You can check out the [repository for MoonGas](https://github.com/albertov19/moonbeam-gas-station){target=\_blank}.

You'll notice that the minimum gas price for Moonbeam is {{ networks.moonbeam.min_gas_price }} Gwei, while the minimum for Moonriver is {{ networks.moonriver.min_gas_price }} Gwei and Moonbase Alpha is {{ networks.moonbase.min_gas_price }} Gwei. This difference stems from the [100 to 1 re-denomination of GLMR](https://moonbeam.network/news/moonbeam-foundation-announces-liquidity-programs-a-new-token-event-and-glmr-redenomination){target=\_blank} and thus the {{ networks.moonbeam.min_gas_price }} Gwei minimum on Moonbeam corresponds to a {{ networks.moonriver.min_gas_price }} Gwei minimum on Moonriver and a {{ networks.moonbase.min_gas_price }} Gwei on Moonbase.

## Introduction {: #introduction }

A Moonbeam development node is your own personal development environment for building and testing applications on Moonbeam. For Ethereum developers, it is comparable to the Hardhat Network. It enables you to get started quickly and easily without the overhead of a relay chain. You can spin up your node with the `--sealing` option to author blocks instantly, manually, or at a custom interval after transactions are received. By default, a block will be created when a transaction is received, which is similar to the default behavior of Hardhat Network's instamine feature.

If you follow this guide to the end, you will have a Moonbeam development node running in your local environment with 10 prefunded [accounts](#pre-funded-development-accounts).

    This tutorial was created using the {{ networks.development.build_tag }} tag of [Moonbase Alpha](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/{{ networks.development.build_tag }}){target=\_blank}. The Moonbeam platform and the [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} components it relies on for Substrate-based Ethereum compatibility are still under very active development.
    The examples in this guide assume you have a MacOS or Ubuntu 22.04-based environment and will need to be adapted accordingly for Windows.

## Spin Up a Moonbeam Development Node {: #spin-up-a-node }

There are two ways to get started running a Moonbeam node. You can use [Docker to run a pre-built binary](#getting-started-with-docker) or you can [compile the binary locally](#getting-started-with-the-binary-file) and set up a development node yourself. Using Docker is a quick and convenient way to get started, as you won't have to install Substrate and all the dependencies, and you can skip the node-building process as well. It does require you to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/){target=\_blank}. On the other hand, if you decide you want to go through the process of building your development node, it could take roughly 30 minutes or longer to complete, depending on your hardware.

### Spin Up a Node with Docker {: #getting-started-with-docker }

Using Docker enables you to spin up a node in a matter of seconds. Once you have Docker installed, you can take the following steps to spin up your node:

1. Execute the following command to download the latest Moonbeam image:

    ```bash
    docker pull moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }}
    ```

    The tail end of the console log should look like this:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>docker pull moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.46.0</span>
  <br>
  <span data-ty>v0.46.0: Pulling from moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam

    <br> Status: Downloaded newer image for moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.46.0
    <br> docker.io/moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.46.0
  </span>
</div>

2. Spin up a Moonbeam development node by running the following Docker command, which will launch the node in instant seal mode for local testing so that blocks are authored instantly as transactions are received:

    === "Ubuntu"

        ```bash
        docker run --rm --name {{ networks.development.container_name }} --network host \
        moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }} \
        --dev --rpc-external
        ```

    === "MacOS"

        ```bash
        docker run --rm --name {{ networks.development.container_name }} -p 9944:9944 \
        moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }} \
        --dev --rpc-external
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```bash
        docker run --rm --name {{ networks.development.container_name }} -p 9944:9944 ^
        moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }} ^
        --dev --rpc-external
        ```

    !!! note "For Apple Silicon users"
        If the Docker commands fail or behave unexpectedly on Apple Silicon, enable **Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon** in Docker Desktop settings and use the `amd64` platform for both pull and run commands:

        ```bash
        docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }}
        ```

        ```bash
        docker run --rm --platform=linux/amd64 --name {{ networks.development.container_name }} -p 9944:9944 \
        moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }} \
        --dev --rpc-external
        ```

        If performance is still insufficient, consider [spinning up a node with a binary file](#getting-started-with-the-binary-file).

If successful, you should see an output showing an idle state waiting for blocks to be authored:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>docker run --rm --name moonbeam_development --network host \
    <br> moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.46.0 \
    <br> --dev --rpc-external
  </span>
  <br>
  <span data-ty>CLI parameter `--execution` has no effect anymore and will be removed in the future!

To continue with the tutorial, the next section is not necessary, as you've already spun up a node with Docker. You can skip ahead to the [Configure your Moonbeam Development Node](#configure-moonbeam-dev-node) section.

### Spin Up a Node with a Binary File {: #getting-started-with-the-binary-file }

As an alternative to using Docker, you can spin up a node using the Moonbeam binary. This method is more time-consuming. Depending on your hardware, the process could take around 30 minutes to complete.

!!! note
    If you know what you are doing, you can directly download the precompiled binaries attached to each release on the [Moonbeam release page](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank}. These will not work in all systems. For example, the binaries only work with x86-64 Linux with specific versions of dependencies. The safest way to ensure compatibility is to compile the binary on the system where it will be run.

To build the binary file, you can take the following steps:

1. Clone a specific tag of the Moonbeam repo, which you can find on the [Moonbeam GitHub repository](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam){target=\_blank}:

    ```bash
    git clone -b {{ networks.development.build_tag }} https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam
    cd moonbeam
    ```

    !!! note
        Spaces in the installation file path will cause a compilation error.

2. If you already have Rust installed, you can skip the next two steps. Otherwise, install Rust and its prerequisites [via Rust's recommended method](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install){target=\_blank} by executing:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

3. Update your PATH environment variable by running:

    ```bash
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

4. Build the development node by running:

    !!! note
        If you are using Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04, then you will need to make sure these additional dependencies have been installed before building the binary:

        ```bash
        apt install clang protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev pkg-config libssl-dev -y 
        ```

        For MacOS users, these dependencies can be installed via Homebrew:

        ```bash
        brew install llvm
        brew install protobuf
        ```

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

    Here is what the tail end of the build output should look like:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>

  </span>
</div>

!!! note
    The initial build will take a while. Depending on your hardware, you should expect approximately 30 minutes for the build process to finish.

Then, you will want to run the node in development mode using the following command:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam --dev
```

!!! note
    For people not familiar with Substrate, the `--dev` flag is a way to run a Substrate-based node in a single-node developer configuration for testing purposes. When you run your node with the `--dev` flag, your node is started in a fresh state, and its state does not persist.

You should see an output that looks like the following, showing an idle state waiting for blocks to be produced:

## Configure Your Moonbeam Development Node {: #configure-moonbeam-dev-node }

Now that you know how to get a standard Moonbeam development node up and running, you may be wondering how you can configure it. The following sections will cover some common configurations you can use when you spin up your node.

### Common Flags to Configure Your Node {: #node-flags }

Flags do not take an argument. To use a flag, add it to the end of a command. For example:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam --dev
```

- **`--dev`** - specifies the development chain
- **`--tmp`** - runs a temporary node in which all of the configuration will be deleted at the end of the process
- **`--rpc-external`** - listen to all RPC and WebSocket interfaces

### Common Options to Configure Your Node {: #node-options }

Options accept an argument to the right of the option. For example:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam --dev --sealing 6000
```

- **`-l <log pattern>` or `--log <log pattern>`** - sets a custom logging filter. The syntax for the log pattern is `<target>=<level>`. For example, to print all of the JSON-RPC logs, the command would look like this: `-l json=trace`
- **`--sealing <interval>`** - when blocks should be sealed in the dev service. Accepted arguments for interval: `instant`, `manual`, or a number representing the timer interval in milliseconds (for example, `6000` will have the node produce blocks every 6 seconds). The default is `instant``. Please refer to the [Configure Block Production](#configure-block-production) section below for more information
- **`--rpc-port <port>`** - sets the unified port for HTTP and WS connections. Accepts a port as the argument. Default is {{ networks.parachain.rpc }}
- **`--ws-port <port>`** - *deprecated as of [client v0.33.0](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/v0.33.0){target=\_blank}, use `--rpc-port` for HTTP and WS connections instead* - sets the WebSockets RPC server TCP port. As of [client v0.30.0](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/v0.30.0){target=\_blank}, it sets the unified port for both HTTP and WS connections. Accepts a port as the argument
- **`--rpc-max-connections <connections>`** - specifies the combined HTTP and WS connection limit. The default is 100 connections
- **`--ws-max-connections <connections>`** - *deprecated as of [client v0.33.0](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/v0.33.0){target=\_blank}, use `--rpc-max-connections` to limit the HTTP and WS connections instead* - this flag adjusts the combined HTTP and WS connection limit. The default is 100 connections
- **`--rpc-cors <origins>`** - specifies the browser origins allowed to access the HTTP and WS RPC servers. The origins can be a comma-separated list of the origins to allow access, or you can also specify `null`. When running a development node, the default is to allow all origins

For a complete list of flags and options, spin up your Moonbeam development node with `--help` added to the end of the command.

### Configure Block Production {: #configure-block-production }

By default, your Moonbeam development node is spun up in instant seal mode, which instantly authors blocks as transactions are received. However, you can specify when blocks should be authored or sealed by using the `--sealing` option.

The `--sealing` flag accepts any of the following arguments:

- `instant` - as we already covered, this is the default option in which blocks are authored as soon as a transaction is received
- `manual` - allows you to produce blocks manually. If a transaction is received, a block will not be produced until you manually create one
- an interval in milliseconds - authors a block on a specific time interval. For example, if you set it to `6000`, you will have the node produce blocks every 6 seconds

The flag should be appended to the start-up command in the following format:

```text
--sealing <interval>
```

If you choose `manual`, you'll need to manually create the blocks yourself, which can be done with the `engine_createBlock` JSON-RPC method:

```text
engine_createBlock(createEmpty: *bool*, finalize: *bool*, parentHash?: *BlockHash*)
```

For example, you can use the following snippet to manually create a block using [Ethers.js](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, an Ethereum library that makes it easy to interact with JSON-RPC methods:

```js
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const produceBlock = async () => {
  // Connect to the Ethereum node (if applicable, replace the URL with your node's address)
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(
    '{{ networks.development.rpc_url }}'
  );

  // Set the custom JSON-RPC method and parameters
  const method = 'engine_createBlock';
  const params = [true, true, null];

  try {
    // Send the custom JSON-RPC call
    const result = await provider.send(method, params);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that may occur
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  }
};

produceBlock();
```

!!! note
    If you're unfamiliar with Ethers, please refer to the [Ethers.js](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank} documentation page to learn more.

## Prefunded Development Accounts {: #pre-funded-development-accounts }

Moonbeam has a [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} system, which enables users to have an Ethereum-styled H160 account that can interact with the Substrate API and the Ethereum API. As a result, you can interact with your account through [Polkadot.js Apps](/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/#connect-polkadotjs-apps){target=\_blank} or [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank} (or any other [EVM wallet](/tokens/connect/){target=\_blank}). In addition, you can also use other [development tools](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/){target=\_blank}, such as [Remix](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} and [Hardhat](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/hardhat/){target=\_blank}.

Your Moonbeam development node comes with ten prefunded Ethereum-styled accounts for development. The addresses are derived from Substrate's canonical development mnemonic:

```text
bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk
```

You can connect any of these accounts to [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}, [Talisman](/tokens/connect/talisman/){target=\_blank}, [Polkadot.js Apps](/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/){target=\_blank}, etc., using their private keys.

## Development Node Endpoints {: #access-your-development-node }

You can access your Moonbeam development node using the following RPC and WSS endpoints:

=== "HTTP"

    ```text
    {{ networks.development.rpc_url }}
    ```

=== "WSS"

    ```text
    {{ networks.development.wss_url }}
    ```

## Block Explorers {: #block-explorers }

For a Moonbeam development node, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Substrate API** — [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944#/explorer){target=\_blank} on WS port `{{ networks.parachain.ws }}`
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC-based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=MoonbeamDevNode){target=\_blank} on HTTP port `{{ networks.parachain.ws }}`

## Debug, Trace, and TxPool APIs {: #debug-trace-txpool-apis }

You can also gain access to some non-standard RPC methods by running a tracing node, which allows developers to inspect and debug transactions during runtime. Tracing nodes use a different Docker image than a standard Moonbeam development node.

To learn how to run a Moonbeam development tracing node, check out the [Run a Tracing Node](/node-operators/networks/tracing-node/){target=\_blank} guide, and be sure to switch to the **Moonbeam Development Node** tab throughout the instructions. Then, to access the non-standard RPC methods with your tracing node, check out the [Debug & Trace](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Purge a Development Node {: #purging-your-node }

If you want to remove data associated with your node, you can purge it. The instructions for purging a node are different depending on how you initially spun up your node.

### Purge a Node Spun Up with Docker {: #purge-docker-node }

If you spun up your node using Docker along with the `-v` flag to specify a mounted directory for your container, you will need to purge that directory. To do so, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/*
```

If you followed the instructions in this guide and did not use the `-v` flag, you can stop and remove the Docker container. The associated data will be removed along with it. To do so, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker stop `CONTAINER_ID` && docker rm `CONTAINER_ID`
```

### Purge a Node Spun up with a Binary File {: #purge-binary-node }

When running a node via the binary file, data is stored in a local directory, typically located in `~/.local/shared/moonbeam/chains/development/db`. If you want to start a fresh instance of the node, you can either delete the content of the folder or run the following command inside the `moonbeam` folder:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam purge-chain --dev -y
```

This will remove the data folder. Note that all chain data is now lost. To learn more about all of the available `purge-chain` commands, you can check out the [Purging Binary Data](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#purging-compiled-binary){target=\_blank} section of our documentation.

# Get Started with Moonbeam

## Network Endpoints {: #network-endpoints }

Moonbeam has two types of endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

If you're looking for your own endpoints suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. Otherwise, to get started quickly you can use one of the following public HTTPS or WSS endpoints:

=== "HTTPS"
    |  Provider   |                              RPC URL                               |   Limits    |
    |:-----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
    |   Dwellir   |         <pre>```https://moonbeam-rpc.dwellir.com```</pre>          | 20 req/sec  |
    | OnFinality  |     <pre>```https://moonbeam.api.onfinality.io/public```</pre>     | 40 req/sec  |
    | UnitedBloc  |          <pre>```https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com```</pre>          | 32 req/sec  |
    | RadiumBlock | <pre>```https://moonbeam.public.curie.radiumblock.co/http```</pre> | 200 req/sec |
    |    1RPC     |               <pre>```https://1rpc.io/glmr```</pre>                | 10k req/day |
    |    Grove    |         <pre>```https://moonbeam.rpc.grove.city/v1/01fdb492```</pre>         | 5k req/day  |



=== "WSS"
    |  Provider   |                            RPC URL                             |   Limits    |
    |:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
    |   Dwellir   |        <pre>```wss://moonbeam-rpc.dwellir.com```</pre>         | 20 req/sec  |
    | OnFinality  |  <pre>```wss://moonbeam.api.onfinality.io/public-ws```</pre>   | 40 req/sec  |
    | UnitedBloc  |         <pre>```wss://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com```</pre>         | 32 req/sec  |
    | RadiumBlock | <pre>```wss://moonbeam.public.curie.radiumblock.co/ws```</pre> | 200 req/sec |
    |    1RPC     |              <pre>```wss://1rpc.io/glmr```</pre>               | 10k req/day |

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

Before getting started, make sure you've retrieved your own endpoint and API key from one of the custom [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}. Then for the [Web3.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}, you can create a local Web3 instance and set the provider to connect to Moonbeam (both HTTP and WS are supported):

```js
const { Web3 } = require('web3'); // Load Web3 library
.
.
.
// Create local Web3 instance - set Moonbeam as provider
const web3 = new Web3('INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT'); // Insert your RPC URL here
```

For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonbeam:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT'; // Insert your RPC URL here

// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1284,
    name: 'moonbeam'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonbeam chain ID is: `1284`, or `0x504` in hex.

## Block Explorers {: #block-explorers }

For Moonbeam, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=Moonbeam){target=\_blank}
 - **Substrate API** — [Subscan](https://moonbeam.subscan.io){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}

For more information on each of the available block explorers, please head to the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation.

## Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to Moonbeam:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbeam">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Moonbeam as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Moonbeam.

If you do not have MetaMask installed, or would like to follow a tutorial to get started, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Configuration {: #configuration }

Please note the following gas configuration parameters. These values are subject to change in future runtime upgrades.

# Quick Start Guide for Developing on Moonbeam

## Quick Overview {: #overview }

Moonbeam is a fully Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on Polkadot. As such, you can interact with Moonbeam via the [Ethereum API](/builders/ethereum/){target=\_blank} and [Substrate API](/builders/substrate/){target=\_blank}.

Although Moonbeam is a Substrate-based platform, Moonbeam uses a [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} system, which replaces Substrate-style accounts and keys with Ethereum-style accounts and keys. As a result, you can interact with your Moonbeam account with [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}, [Ledger](/tokens/connect/ledger/){target=\_blank}, and other Ethereum-compatible wallets by simply adding Moonbeam's network configurations. Similarly, you can develop on Moonbeam using Ethereum [libraries](/builders/ethereum/libraries/){target=\_blank} and [development environments](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/){target=\_blank}.

## Moonbeam Networks {: #moonbeam-networks }

To get started developing on Moonbeam, it's important to be aware of the various networks within the Moonbeam ecosystem.

!!! note
    A Moonbeam development node doesn't have a relay chain as its purpose is to be your own personal development environment where you can get started developing quickly without the overhead of a relay chain.

### Network Configurations {: #network-configurations }

When working with developer tools, depending on the tool, you might need to configure Moonbeam to interact with the network. To do so, you can use the following information:

### Block Explorers {: #explorers }

Moonbeam provides two different kinds of explorers: ones to query the Ethereum API, and others dedicated to the Substrate API. All EVM-based transactions are accessible via the Ethereum API whereas the Substrate API can be relied upon for Substrate-native functions such as governance, staking, and some information about EVM-based transactions. For more information on each explorer, please check out the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} page.

# XCM Instructions

## Introduction {: #introduction }

XCM messages contain a series of [actions and instructions](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#5-the-xcvm-instruction-set){target=\_blank} that are executed by the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM). An action (for example, transferring a token from one blockchain to another) consists of instructions that the XCVM partly executes in the origin and destination chains.

For example, an XCM message that transfers DOT from Polkadot to Moonbeam will include the following XCM instructions (in that order), some of which are executed on Polkadot and some of which are executed on Moonbeam:

 1. [TransferReserveAsset](#transfer-reserve-asset) — executed in Polkadot
 2. [ReserveAssetDeposited](#reserve-asset-deposited) — executed in Moonbeam
 3. [ClearOrigin](#clear-origin) — executed in Moonbeam
 4. [BuyExecution](#buy-execution) — executed in Moonbeam
 5. [DepositAsset](#deposit-asset) — executed in Moonbeam

Building the instructions for an XCM message from scratch is not an easy task. Consequently, there are wrapper functions and pallets that developers can leverage to use XCM features. The [Polkadot XCM](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank} and [XCM Transactor](/builders/interoperability/xcm/remote-execution/substrate-calls/xcm-transactor-pallet/){target=\_blank} Pallets provide functions with a predefined set of XCM instructions to either send [XC-20s](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/){target=\_blank} or remotely execute on other chains via XCM.

If you're interested in experimenting with different combinations of instructions, you can [use the Polkadot XCM Pallet to execute and send custom XCM messages](/builders/interoperability/xcm/send-execute-xcm/){target=\_blank}.

This guide provides an overview of some of the most commonly used XCM instructions, including those in the above example.

## Buy Execution {: #buy-execution }

The [`BuyExecution`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#buyexecution){target=\_blank} instruction typically gets executed in the target chain. It takes assets from the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM), to pay for execution fees. The target chain determines the fees to pay.

## Clear Origin {: #clear-origin }

The [`ClearOrigin`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#clearorigin){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It clears the origin of the XCM author, thereby ensuring that later XCM instructions cannot command the authority of the author.

## Deposit Asset {: #deposit-asset }

The [`DepositAsset`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#depositasset){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It removes the assets from the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM), and sends them to a destination account on the target chain.

## Descend Origin {: #descend-origin }

The [`DescendOrigin`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#descendorigin){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It mutates the origin on the target chain to match the origin on the source chain, ensuring execution on the target chain occurs on behalf of the same entity initiating the XCM message on the source chain.

## Initiate Reserve Withdraw {: #initiate-reserve-withdraw }

The [`InitiateReserveWithdraw`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#initiatereservewithdraw){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the source chain. It removes the assets from the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM), (essentially burning them), and sends an XCM message to the reserve chain starting with the `WithdrawAsset` instruction.

## Refund Surplus {: #refund-surplus }

The [`RefundSurplus`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#refundsurplus){target=\_blank} instruction typically gets executed in the target chain after the XCM is processed. This instruction will take any leftover assets from the `BuyExecution` instruction and put the assets into the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM).

## Reserve Asset Deposited {: #reserve-asset-deposited }

The [`ReserveAssetDeposited`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#reserveassetdeposited-){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It takes a representation of the assets received in the Sovereign account and places them into the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM).

## Set Appendix {: #set-appendix }

The [`SetAppendix`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#setappendix){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It sets the appendix register, which holds code that should be run after the current execution is finished.

## Transfer Reserve Asset {: #transfer-reserve-asset }

The [`TransferReserveAsset`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#transferreserveasset){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the reserve chain. It moves assets from the origin account and deposits them into a destination account on the target chain. It then sends an XCM message to the target chain with the `ReserveAssetDeposited` instruction, followed by the XCM instructions that are to be executed.

## Transact {: #transact }

The [`Transact`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#transact){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It dispatches encoded call data from a given origin, allowing for the execution of specific operations or functions on the target chain.

## Withdraw Asset {: #withdraw-asset }

The [`WithdrawAsset`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#withdrawasset){target=\_blank} instruction can be executed in either the source or target chain. It removes assets and places them into the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM).

# Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Polkadot's architecture](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-architecture/){target=\_blank} allows parachains to natively interoperate with each other, enabling cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset.

To do so, a [Cross-Consensus Message (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank} format defines a language around how the message transfer between two interoperating blockchains should be performed. XCM is not specific to Polkadot, as it aims to be a generic and extensible language between different consensus systems.

This page is a brief introduction and overview of XCM and other related elements. More information can be found in [Polkadot's Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank}.

## General XCM Definitions {: #general-xcm-definitions }

- **XCM** — stands for Cross-Consensus Message. It is a general way for consensus systems to communicate with each other
 - **VMP** — stands for Vertical Message Passing, one of the transport methods for XCMs. It allows parachains to exchange messages with the relay chain. *UMP* (Upward Message Passing) enables parachains to send messages to their relay chain, while *DMP* (Downward Message Passing) enables the relay chain to pass messages down to one of their parachains
 - **XCMP** — stands for Cross-Consensus Message Passing, one of the transport methods for XCMs. It allows parachains to exchange messages with other parachains on the same relay chain
 - **HRMP** — stands for Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing, a stop-gap protocol while a full XCMP implementation is launched. It has the same interface as XCMP, but messages are stored on the relay chain
- **Sovereign account** —  an account each chain in the ecosystem has, one for the relay chain and the other for other parachains. It is calculated as the `blake2` hash of a specific word and parachain ID concatenated (`blake2(para+ParachainID)` for the Sovereign account in the relay chain, and `blake2(sibl+ParachainID)` for the Sovereign account in other parachains), truncating the hash to the correct length. The account is owned by root and can only be used through SUDO (if available) or [governance (referenda)](/learn/features/governance/){target=\_blank}. The Sovereign account typically signs XCM messages in other chains in the ecosystem
 - **Multilocation** —  a way to specify a point in the entire relay chain/parachain ecosystem relative to a given origin. For example, it can be used to specify a specific parachain, asset, account, or even a pallet inside a parachain. In general terms, a multilocation is defined with a `parents` and an `interior`:
 
    - `parents` - refers to how many "hops" into a parent blockchain you need to take from a given origin
    - `interior` - refers to how many fields you need to define the target point. 
    
    For example, to target a parachain with ID `1000` from another parachain, the multilocation would be `{ "parents": 1, "interior": { "X1": [{ "Parachain": 1000 }]}}`

## Cross-Chain Transport Protocols via XCM {: #xcm-transport-protocols }

XCM implements two cross-consensus or transport protocols for acting on XCM messages between its constituent parachains, Moonbeam being one of them:

- **Vertical Message Passing (VMP)** — once a project is onboarded as a parachain, it automatically has a bi-directional communication channel with the relay chain. Therefore, there is no need for chain registration. VMP is divided into two kinds of message-passing transport protocols:

    * **Upward Message Passing (UMP)** — allows parachains to send messages to their relay chain, for example, from Moonbeam to Polkadot
    * **Downward Message Passing (DMP)** — allows the relay chain to pass messages down to one of their parachains, for example, from Polkadot to Moonbeam

- **Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP)** — allows two parachains to exchange messages as long as they are connected to the same relay chain. Cross-chain transactions are resolved using a simple queuing mechanism based on a Merkle tree to ensure fidelity. Collators exchange messages between parachains, while the relay chain validators will verify that the message transmission happened

!!! note
    Currently, while XCMP is being developed, a stop-gap protocol is implemented called Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP), in which the messages are stored in and read from the relay chain. This will be deprecated in the future for the full XCMP implementation.

![Vertical Message Passing and Cross-chain Message Passing Overview](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-1.webp)

## Establishing Cross-Chain Communication {: #channel-registration }

Before two chains can start communicating, a messaging channel must be opened. Channels are unidirectional, meaning that a channel from chain A to chain B will only pass messages from A to B. Therefore, two channels must be opened to send messages back and forth.

A channel for XCMs between the relay chain and parachain is automatically opened when a connection is established. However, when parachain A wants to open a communication channel with parachain B, parachain A must send an open channel extrinsic to its network. This extrinsic is an XCM as well!

Even though parachain A has expressed its intentions of opening an XCM channel with parachain B, the latter has not signaled to the relay chain its intentions to receive messages from parachain A. Therefore, to have an established channel, parachain B must send an extrinsic (an XCM) to the relay chain. The accepting channel extrinsic is similar to the previous one. However, the encoded call data only includes the new method (accept channel) and the parachain ID of the sender (parachain A in this example). Once both parachains have agreed, the channel is opened within the following epoch.

To learn more about the channel registration process, please refer to the [How to Establish an XC Integration with Moonbeam](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc-registration/xc-integration/){target=\_blank} guide.

![XCM Channel Registration Overview](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-2.webp)

Once the channel is established, cross-chain messages can be sent between parachains. For asset transfers, assets need to be registered before being transferred through XCMs, either by being baked into the runtime as a constant or through a pallet. Moonbeam relies on a Substrate pallet to handle asset registration without the need for runtime upgrades, making the process a lot simpler.

To learn how to register an asset on Moonbeam and the information necessary to add Moonbeam assets to another chain, please refer to the [How to Register Cross-Chain Assets](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc-registration/assets/){target=\_blank} guide.

## XCM on Moonbeam {: #moonbeam-and-xcm }

As Moonbeam is a parachain within the Polkadot ecosystems, one of the most direct implementations of XCM is to enable asset transfer from Polkadot and other parachains from/to Moonbeam. This allows users to bring their tokens to Moonbeam and all its dApps.

To this end, Moonbeam has introduced [XC-20s](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/){target=\_blank}, which expand on Moonbeam's unique Ethereum compatibility features. XC-20s allow Polkadot native assets to be represented via a standard [ERC-20 interface](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/assets-erc20/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank} through a precompiled contract. When these assets are registered on Moonbeam, they can be set as XCM execution fee assets. Consequently, when a user transfers such an asset to Moonbeam, a small part of the amount will be used to cover the XCM execution fees.

In addition, ERC-20s that are deployed to Moonbeam can be sent to other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem via XCM. Consequently, from a developer's perspective, XC-20s are ERC-20 tokens with the added benefit of being an XCM cross-chain asset, and dApps can easily support them through a familiar ERC-20 interface.

![Moonbeam XC-20 XCM Integration With Polkadot](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-3.webp)

To send XC-20s across the Polkadot ecosystem from Moonbeam, developers need to use the [Polkadot XCM Pallet](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank} for transfers via the Substrate API and the [X-Tokens Precompile](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xtokens-precompile/){target=\_blank} or the [XCM Precompile](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/eth-api/){target=\_blank} for transfers via the Ethereum API.

Another unique feature of Moonbeam is the ability to initiate XCM actions from EVM smart contracts or to call its EVM through XCM messages via remote execution. This unlocks a new set of possibilities, where contracts on Moonbeam can access parachain-specific functionalities via XCM, or other parachain ecosystems can use EVM smart contracts on Moonbeam to expand their functions.

The following sections provide a high-level overview of the main use cases mentioned before.

### XCM Transfers between Moonbeam & Polkadot {: #transfers-moonbeam-polkadot }

As Moonbeam is a parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem, a straightforward implementation of XCM + VMP is DOT transfers from/to Polkadot/Moonbeam. To this end, DOT was registered as [_xcDOT_](https://moonscan.io/token/0xffffffff1fcacbd218edc0eba20fc2308c778080){target=\_blank} on Moonbeam.

Alice (Polkadot) wants to transfer a certain amount of DOT from Polkadot to her account on Moonbeam, named Alith. Therefore, she initiates an XCM that expresses her intentions. For such transfers, Moonbeam owns a Sovereign account on Polkadot.

Consequently, the XCM message execution on Polkadot will transfer the amount of DOT to Moonbeam's Sovereign account on Polkadot. Once the assets are deposited, the second part of the message is sent to Moonbeam.

Moonbeam will locally execute the action the XCM message is programmed to do. In this case, it is to mint and transfer the same amount of _xcDOT_ to the account defined by Alice, which in this case is Alith. The fee to execute the XCM in the target parachain is paid in the asset being transferred (_xcDOT_ for this example).

![Transfers from the Relay Chain to Moonbeam](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-4.webp)

Note the following:

- The Alice and Alith accounts can be different. For example, Polkadot's accounts are SR25519 (or ED25519), while Moonbeam's are ECDSA (Ethereum-styled) accounts. They can also have different owners
- There is a certain degree of trust where one chain relies on the other to execute its part of the XCM message. This is programmed at a runtime level so that it can be easily verified
- For this example, _xcDOT_ is a wrapped representation of the original DOT being held in Moonbeam's Sovereign account on Polkadot. _xcDOT_ can be transferred within Moonbeam at any time, and they can be redeemed for DOT on a 1:1 basis as well (minus some fees)

Alith deposited her _xcDOT_ in a liquidity pool. Next, Charleth acquires some _xcDOT_ by swapping against that liquidity pool, and he wants to transfer some _xcDOT_ to Charley's Polkadot account. Therefore, he initiates an XCM that expresses his intentions.

Consequently, the XCM message execution on Moonbeam will burn the number of _xcDOT_. Once the assets are burned, the second part of the message is sent to Polkadot.

Polkadot will execute the action the XCM message is programmed to do locally. In this case, it is to transfer the same amount of _xcDOT_ burned from the Moonbeam Sovereign account to the account defined by Charleth, which in this case is Charley.

### XCM Transfers between Moonbeam & Other Parachains {: #transfers-moonbeam-other-parachains }

Since Moonbeam is a parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem, a straightforward implementation of XCM and XCMP asset transfers from and to Moonbeam and other parachains. This section gives a high-level overview of the main differences compared to XCMs from Polkadot/Moonbeam.

The first requirement is that a bidirectional channel between the parachains must exist, and the asset being transferred must be registered in the target parachain. Only when both conditions are met can XCMs be sent between parachains.

Then, when Alith (Moonbeam) transfers a certain amount of GLMR from Moonbeam to another account (Alice) in a target parachain, tokens are sent to a Sovereign Account owned by that target parachain on Moonbeam.

As the XCM message is executed in the target parachain, it is expected that this will mint and transfer the same amount of _xcGLMR_ (cross-chain GLMR) to the account defined by Alith, which in this case is Alice. The fee to execute the XCM in the target parachain is paid in the transferred asset (_xcGLMR_ for this example).

![Transfers from Moonbeam to another Parachain](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-6.webp)

As explained in the previous section, the process is similar for _xcGLMR_ to move back to Moonbeam. First, the XCM message execution burns the number of _xcGLMR_ returned to Moonbeam. Once burned, the remnant part of the message is sent to Moonbeam via the relay chain. Moonbeam will locally execute the XCM message's and transfer GLMR (the same amount of burned _xcGLMR_) from the target parachain Sovereign account to the specified address.

### Remote Execution between Other Chains & Moonbeam {: #execution-chains-moonbeam }

As mentioned before, XCM also enables remote execution from/to Moonbeam to other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem.

Similarly to the other use cases, it is necessary for XCM-specific channels to be established before remote execution can happen between the chains. Channels are general-purpose, so they can be used for both asset transfers and remote execution.

Another important component is the asset for which the remote execution fees are paid. On Moonbeam, when an XC-20 is registered, it can be set as an XCM execution fee asset. Consequently, when transferring that XC-20 to Moonbeam, the XCM execution fee is deducted from the amount being transferred. For remote execution, users can include a small amount of tokens in the XCM message to cover XCM execution fees.

Alice (Polkadot) wants to perform a certain remote action through a smart contract on Moonbeam. Therefore, she initiates an XCM that expresses her intentions; she must have previously funded the XCM execution account she owns on Moonbeam with either GLMR or _xcDOT_.

Moonbeam will locally execute the action the XCM message is programmed to do. In this case, it is to withdraw the asset decided by Alice for the XCM execution fee and buy some execution time on Moonbeam to execute the smart contract call on Moonbeam's EVM.

# Remote Execution via XCM

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The [Cross-Consensus Message (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank} format defines how messages can be sent between interoperable blockchains. This format opens the door to sending an XCM message that executes an arbitrary set of bytes in a Moonbeam-based network, the relay chain, or other parachains in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystems.

Remote execution via XCM opens a new set of possibilities for cross-chain interactions, from chains executing actions on other chains to users performing remote actions without switching chains.

This page covers the fundamentals of XCM remote execution. If you want to learn how to perform remote execution via XCM, please refer to the [Remote Execution via the Substrate API](/builders/interoperability/xcm/remote-execution/substrate-calls/xcm-transactor-pallet/){target=\_blank} or the [Remote Execution via the Ethereum API](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xtokens-precompile/){target=\_blank} guides.

## Execution Origin {: #execution-origin }

Generally speaking, all transactions have an origin, which is where a call comes from. Ethereum transactions have only one origin type, the `msg.sender`, which is the account that initiated the transaction.

Substrate-based transactions are more complex, as they can have different origins with different privilege levels. This is similar to having an EVM smart contract call with a specific `require` statement in which the call must come from an allowed address. In contrast, these privilege levels are programmed in the Substrate-based runtime itself.

Origins are super important across different components of the Substrate runtime and, hence, the Moonbeam runtime. For example, they define the authority level they inherit in the [on-chain governance implementation](/learn/features/governance/){target=\_blank}.

During the execution of an XCM message, the origin defines the context in which the XCM is being executed. By default, the XCM is executed by the source chain's Sovereign account in the destination chain. This Polkadot-specific property of having remote origins that are calculated when executing XCM is known as [Computed Origins](/builders/interoperability/xcm/remote-execution/computed-origins/){target=\_blank} (formerly known as Multilocation Derivative Accounts).

Depending on the destination chain's configuration, including the `DescendOrigin` XCM instruction can mutate the origin from which the XCM message is executed. This property is significant for remote XCM execution, as the action being executed considers the context of the newly mutated origin and not the source chain's Sovereign account.

## XCM Instructions for Remote Execution {: #xcm-instructions-remote-execution }

The core XCM instructions required to perform remote execution on Moonbeam (as an example) via XCM are the following:

 - [`DescendOrigin`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#descend-origin){target=\_blank} - (optional) gets executed in Moonbeam. Mutates the origin to create a new Computed Origin that represents a keyless account controlled via XCM by the sender in the source chain
 - [`WithdrawAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#withdraw-asset){target=\_blank} - gets executed in Moonbeam. Takes funds from the Computed Origin
 - [`BuyExecution`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#buy-execution){target=\_blank} - gets executed in Moonbeam. Uses the funds taken by the previous XCM instruction to pay for the XCM execution, including the remote call
 - [`Transact`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#transact){target=\_blank} - gets executed in Moonbeam. Executes the arbitrary bytes provided in the XCM instruction

The XCM instructions detailed above can be complemented by other XCM instructions to handle certain scenarios, like failure on execution, more accurately. One example is the inclusion of [`SetAppendix`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#set-appendix){target=\_blank}, [`RefundSurplus`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#refund-surplus){target=\_blank}, and [`Deposit`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#deposit-asset){target=\_blank}.

## General Remote Execution via XCM Flow {: #general-remote-execution-via-xcm-flow }

A user initiates a transaction in the source chain through a pallet that builds the XCM with at least the [required XCM instructions for remote execution](#xcm-instructions-remote-execution). The transaction is executed in the source chain, which sends an XCM message with the given instructions to the destination chain.

The XCM message arrives at the destination chain, which executes it. It is executed with the source chain's Sovereign account as a Computed Origin by default. One example that uses this type of origin is when chains open or accept an HRMP channel on the relay chain.

If the XCM message included a [`DescendOrigin`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#descend-origin){target=\_blank} instruction, the destination chain may mutate the origin to calculate a new Computed Origin (as is the case with Moonbeam-based networks).

Next, [`WithdrawAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#withdraw-asset){target=\_blank} takes funds from the Computed Origin (either a Sovereign account or mutated), which are then used to pay for the XCM execution through the [`BuyExecution`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#buy-execution){target=\_blank} XCM instruction. Note that on both instructions, you need to specify which asset you want to use. In addition, you must include the bytes to be executed in the amount of execution to buy.

Lastly, [`Transact`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#transact){target=\_blank} executes an arbitrary set of bytes that correspond to a pallet and function in the destination chain. You have to specify the type of origin to use (typically `SovereignAccount`) and the weight required to execute the bytes (similar to gas in the Ethereum realm).

# Overview of XC-20s

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The [Cross-Consensus Message (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank} format provides a universal way for blockchains to exchange messages and transfer assets. To extend this interoperability to the EVM, Moonbeam introduced XC-20s, ERC-20 tokens on Moonbeam that are fully compatible with XCM transfers.

Any ERC-20 deployed on Moonbeam can be configured as an XC-20, making it accessible to any chain connected via XCM. This allows EVM-focused developers to work with familiar ERC-20 workflows while benefiting from Polkadot’s native cross-chain functionality, all without needing Substrate-specific expertise.

From a technical standpoint, local XC-20s are ERC-20 tokens originating on Moonbeam (including bridged tokens deemed native once issued on Moonbeam), whereas external XC-20s are wrapped representations of tokens whose canonical ledger exists on another parachain or the relay chain. In all cases, XC-20s function just like standard ERC-20s—supporting common EVM-based use cases (such as DeFi, DEXs, and lending platforms)—but with the added advantage of seamless cross-chain operability.

![Moonbeam XC-20 XCM Integration With Polkadot](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-3.webp)

This page aims to cover the basics on XC-20s; if you want to learn how to interact with or transfer XC-20s, please refer to the [Send XC-20s guide](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/overview/){target=\_blank}.

## Types of XC-20s {: #types-of-xc-20s }

There are two types of XC-20s: local and external.

### What are Local XC-20s? {: #local-xc20s }

Local XC-20s are all ERC-20s that exist on the EVM, and that can be transferred cross-chain through XCM. For local XC-20s to be transferred to another parachain, the asset must be registered on that chain. When transferring local XC-20s, the underlying tokens reside in the destination chain's Sovereign account on Moonbeam. A [sovereign account](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/sovereign-accounts/){target=\_blank} is a keyless account governed by a blockchain runtime—rather than an individual—that can hold assets and interact with other chains. Local XC-20s must follow [the ERC-20 interface outlined in this guide](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/interact/#the-erc20-interface){target=\_blank}. They must implement the standard ERC-20 function signatures, including the correct function selector of the `transfer` function as described in [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank}. However, additional functionality can still be added as long as it doesn’t break the base methods. 

Creating a local XC-20 is equivalent to deploying a standard ERC-20 and enabling cross-chain features on any Moonbeam network.

### What are External XC-20s? {: #external-xc20s }

External XC-20s are cross-chain tokens originating from another parachain or the relay chain, and they are represented on Moonbeam as ERC-20 tokens. The original tokens remain locked in a Moonbeam sovereign account on their home chain, while the wrapped ERC-20 representation can be freely utilized on Moonbeam. When you transfer external XC-20s, the canonical assets remain in the sovereign account on their source chain, while the ERC-20 representation is what circulates on Moonbeam.

External XC-20s all have _xc_ prepended to their names to distinguish them as cross-chain assets. For example, DOT, native to the Polkadot relay chain, is known as xcDOT when represented as an XC-20 on Moonbeam.

### Local XC-20s vs External XC-20s {: #local-xc-20s-vs-external-xc-20s }

Local XC-20s are EVM-native ERC-20 tokens whose “home” (or reserve chain) is Moonbeam from a Polkadot perspective. This includes tokens originally bridged in from outside Polkadot (for example, Wormhole-wrapped ETH), because once they’re issued on Moonbeam as ERC-20s, Polkadot views them as local to Moonbeam. When local XC-20s are transferred to another parachain, the tokens move into that chain’s sovereign account on Moonbeam.

External XC-20s, on the other hand, are ERC-20 representations of tokens whose canonical ledger remains on another parachain or the relay chain. Moonbeam holds the “wrapped” version, while the underlying tokens stay locked in Moonbeam’s sovereign account on the originating chain.

From a cross-chain transfer perspective, local and external XC-20s can be sent through Polkadot’s XCM infrastructure using the Ethereum or Substrate API. Because the underlying asset is an ERC-20 with EVM bytecode following the [EIP-20 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank}, both transfers initiated via the Substrate and Ehereum APIs generate EVM logs visible to EVM-based explorers such as [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank}. In contrast, you can't send a regular ERC-20 transfer using the Substrate API. Aside from cross-chain transfers through XCM, all other XC-20 interactions (such as querying balances or adjusting allowances) must occur in the EVM.

Cross-chain transfers of XC-20s are executed via the Polkadot XCM Pallet, which utilizes regular mint, burn, and transfer mechanisms of ERC-20s for the XCM asset flow. If you’d like to learn how to send XC-20s using that pallet, refer to the [Using the Polkadot XCM Pallet](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Asset Reserves {: #asset-reserves }

When transferring tokens across chains in the Polkadot or Kusama ecosystems, each token has a “reserve” chain that holds its canonical ledger—the source of truth for minting, burning, and supply management. For XC-20s, understanding which chain is the reserve determines whether the asset is managed locally on Moonbeam or remotely on another chain.

Regardless of where the reserve is located, XC-20s on Moonbeam are still ERC-20 tokens that developers and users can interact with in the EVM. However, from an XCM perspective, the reserve chain determines how the tokens are locked, unlocked, minted, or burned behind the scenes when performing cross-chain operations.

### Local Reserve Assets {: #local-reserve-assets }

A local reserve asset on Moonbeam is a token whose canonical ledger—from an XCM perspective—resides natively on Moonbeam. In other words, Moonbeam is the asset’s home chain, where minting and burning take place. 

For example, Wormhole-wrapped ETH (wETH) is considered a local reserve asset on Moonbeam, even though Ethereum is the ultimate source of ETH. Once ETH is wrapped by Wormhole and enters the Polkadot ecosystem via Moonbeam, wETH can be transferred to other parachains through [Moonbeam Routed Liquidity (MRL)](/builders/interoperability/mrl/){target=\_blank}.

The important caveat is that, on a purely Ethereum-level view, ETH remains governed by and minted on Ethereum. However, from an XCM standpoint, wETH on Moonbeam is treated as a local reserve asset, meaning the canonical supply of wETH (as far as Polkadot ecosystems are concerned) exists on Moonbeam.

### Remote Reserve Assets {: #remote-reserve-assets }

A remote reserve asset is a token whose canonical ledger—the source of truth for minting and burning—resides on a chain different from where it’s currently in use. In the case of xcDOT on Moonbeam, the underlying DOT tokens representing the xcDOT remain locked in Moonbeam’s sovereign account on the Polkadot relay chain, while xcDOT functions as a wrapped representation in Moonbeam’s EVM environment.

Users can hold and transact with xcDOT on Moonbeam (for DeFi, governance, and more), knowing that the underlying DOT is safely locked on the relay chain. At any point, the wrapped xcDOT can be redeemed for the original DOT, effectively burning the xcDOT and unlocking the corresponding DOT tokens on Polkadot.

## Current List of External XC-20s {: #current-xc20-assets }

The current list of available external XC-20 assets per network is as follows:

### Retrieve List of External XC-20s and Their Metadata {: #list-xchain-assets }

To fetch a list of the currently available external XC-20s along with their associated metadata, you can query the chain state using the [Polkadot.js API](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}. You'll take the following steps:

1. Create an API provider for the network you'd like to get the list of assets for. You can use the following WSS endpoints for each network:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```text
        wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```text
        wss://wss.api.moonriver.moonbeam.network
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```text
        {{ networks.moonbase.wss_url }}
        ```

2. Query the `assets` pallet for all assets
3. Iterate over the list of assets to get all of the asset IDs along with their associated metadata

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

const getXc20s = async () => {
  try {
    const substrateProvider = new WsProvider('INSERT_WSS_ENDPOINT');
    const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: substrateProvider });

    const assets = await api.query.assets.asset.entries();

    await Promise.all(
      assets.map(async ([{ args: [id] }]) => {
        try {
          const metadata = await api.query.assets.metadata(id);
          const humanMetadata = metadata.toHuman();
          
          console.log(`\nAsset ID: ${id}`);
          console.log('Metadata:');
          console.log('  Name:', humanMetadata.name);
          console.log('  Symbol:', humanMetadata.symbol);
          console.log('  Decimals:', humanMetadata.decimals);
          console.log('  Deposit:', humanMetadata.deposit);
          console.log('  IsFrozen:', humanMetadata.isFrozen);
          console.log('-----');
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Error fetching metadata for asset ${id}:`, error);
        }
      })
    );

    await api.disconnect();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in getXc20s:', error);
  }
};

getXc20s().catch(console.error);
```

The result will display the asset ID along with some additional information for all of the registered external XC-20s.

## Retrieve Local XC-20 Metadata {: #retrieve-local-xc20-metadata }

Since local XC-20s are ERC-20s on Moonbeam that can be transferred via XCM to another parachain, you can interact with local XC-20s like you would an ERC-20. As long as you have the address and the ABI of the ERC-20, you can retrieve its metadata by interacting with its ERC-20 interface to retrieve the name, symbol, and decimals for the asset.

The following is an example that retrieves the asset metadata for the [Jupiter token](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/token/0x9aac6fb41773af877a2be73c99897f3ddfacf576){target=\_blank} on Moonbase Alpha:

    chainId: 1287, // 0x507 in hex,
  },
};

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerRPC.moonbase.rpc, {
  chainId: providerRPC.moonbase.chainId,
  name: providerRPC.moonbase.name,

# Overview of XC-20 Transfers

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Assets can move between parachains using XCM. Two main approaches exist:

- **Asset teleporting** – destroys tokens on the reserve chain and mints the same amount on the destination chain. Each chain holds the native asset as a reserve, similar to a burn-mint bridging mechanism. Because each chain can create tokens, a degree of trust is required
- **Remote transfers** – moves tokens from the reserve chain to a Sovereign account (an account on the reserve chain trustlessly controlled by the destination chain). The destination chain then mints a wrapped (also called “virtual” or “cross-chain”) representation. This wrapped version is always interchangeable 1:1 with the original asset, functioning like a lock-mint and burn-unlock bridge. The chain where the asset originates is known as the reserve chain

![Asset Teleporting and Remote Transfers](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/overview/overview-1.webp)

Moonbeam currently uses remote transfers for XC-20 transfers.

This page covers the fundamentals of XCM-based remote transfers. To learn how to perform XC-20 transfers, refer to the the [XC-20 transfers via the Substrate API](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank} guide.

## XCM Instructions for Asset Transfers {: #xcm-instructions-for-asset-transfers }

The XCM Pallet and Precompile abstract much of the complexity involved in cross-chain asset transfers, automatically constructing the necessary XCM messages. Nevertheless, having a basic understanding of the underlying instructions can be useful. 

For reference, you can find the Polkadot XCM Pallet extrinsics for sending XC-20s in the [Using the Polkadot XCM Pallet To Send XC-20s guide](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=_blank}.

The instructions in each XCM transfer vary depending on the asset and the transfer route. For example, returning a native token like xcDOT to its reserve chain (from Moonbeam to Polkadot) differs from sending DOT from Polkadot to Moonbeam. Below are examples of the instructions commonly involved in these token transfers.

### Instructions to Transfer a Reserve Asset from the Reserve Chain {: #transfer-native-from-origin }

When DOT is transferred from Polkadot to Moonbeam, the following XCM instructions are executed in sequence:

1. [`TransferReserveAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#transfer-reserve-asset){target=_blank} - executes on Polkadot, moving the DOT from the sender and depositing it into Moonbeam’s Sovereign account on Polkadot

2. [`ReserveAssetDeposited`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#reserve-asset-deposited){target=_blank} - executes on Moonbeam, minting the corresponding ERC-20 representation of DOT (xcDOT) on Moonbeam

3. [`ClearOrigin`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#clear-origin){target=_blank} - executes on Moonbeam, clearing any origin data—previously set to Polkadot’s Sovereign account

4. [`BuyExecution`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#buy-execution){target=_blank} - executes on Moonbeam, determining the execution fees. Here, a portion of the newly minted xcDOT is used to pay the cost of XCM

5. [`DepositAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#deposit-asset){target=_blank} - executes on Moonbeam, delivering the xcDOT to the intended recipient’s account on Moonbeam

This process invokes `TransferReserveAsset` with `assets`, `dest`, and `xcm`parameters. Within the `xcm` parameter, you typically specify the `BuyExecution` and `DepositAsset` instructions. As shown in the [`TransferReserveAsset` instruction](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{ polkadot_sdk }}/polkadot/xcm/xcm-executor/src/lib.rs#L630){target=\_blank}, the flow also includes `ReserveAssetDeposited` and `ClearOrigin` to complete the transfer.

For more information on constructing an XCM message for asset transfers, such as DOT to Moonbeam, refer to the [Polkadot XCM Pallet guide](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank}.

### Instructions to Transfer a Reserve Asset back to the Reserve Chain {: #transfer-native-to-origin }

In scenarios where you want to move an asset back to its reserve chain, such as sending xcDOT from Moonbeam to Polkadot, Moonbeam uses the following set of XCM instructions:

1. [`WithdrawAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#withdraw-asset){target=_blank} – executes on Moonbeam, taking the specified token (xcDOT) from the sender

2. [`InitiateReserveWithdraw`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#initiate-reserve-withdraw){target=_blank} – executes on Moonbeam, which, burns the token on Moonbeam (removing the wrapped representation), and sends an XCM message to Polkadot, indicating the tokens should be released there 

3. [`WithdrawAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#withdraw-asset){target=_blank} – executes on Polkadot, removing the tokens from Moonbeam’s Sovereign account on Polkadot

4. [`ClearOrigin`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#clear-origin){target=_blank} – gets executed on Polkadot. Clears any origin data (e.g., the Sovereign account on Moonbeam)

5. [`BuyExecution`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#buy-execution){target=_blank} – Polkadot determines the execution fees and uses part of the DOT being transferred to pay for them

6. [`DepositAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#deposit-asset){target=_blank} – finally, the native DOT tokens are deposited into the specified Polkadot account

Steps 3 through 6 are automatically triggered by the `InitiateReserveWithdraw` instruction (step 2) and execute on Polkadot. Once `InitiateReserveWithdraw` is invoked on Moonbeam, the assembled XCM message instructs Polkadot to run those final instructions, completing the cross-chain transfer. In other words, while Moonbeam constructs the XCM instructions behind the scenes, they ultimately execute on Polkadot to complete the asset’s return to its reserve chain.

For more information on constructing an XCM message to transfer reserve assets to a target chain, such as xcDOT to Polkadot, you refer to the guide to the [Polkadot XCM Pallet](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=_blank}.

!!! note
	The specific instructions may vary over time, but this overall flow remains consistent: the tokens are withdrawn from the user on Moonbeam, burned from the local representation, and unlocked on the reserve chain. At the end of the process, they become fully accessible again on their reserve chain.

# Run a Collator on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Collators are members of the network that maintain the parachains they take part in. They run a full node (for both their particular parachain and the relay chain), and they produce the state transition proof for relay chain validators.

There are some [requirements](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/){target=\_blank} that need to be considered prior to becoming a collator candidate including machine, bonding, account, and community requirements.

Candidates will need a minimum amount of tokens bonded (self-bonded) to be considered eligible. Only a certain number of the top collator candidates by total stake, including self-bonded and delegated stake, will be in the active set of collators. Otherwise, the collator will remain in the candidate pool.

Once a candidate is selected to be in the active set of collators, they are eligible to produce blocks.

Moonbeam uses the [Nimbus Parachain Consensus Framework](/learn/features/consensus/){target=\_blank}. This provides a two-step filter to allocate candidates to the active set of collators, then assign collators to a block production slot:

 - The parachain staking filter selects the top candidates in terms of tokens staked in each network. For the exact number of top candidates per each network and the minimum bond amount, you can check out the [Minimum Collator Bond](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#minimum-collator-bond){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. This filtered pool is called selected candidates (also known as the active set), which are rotated every round
 - The fixed size subset filter picks a pseudo-random subset of the previously selected candidates for each block production slot

Users can spin up full nodes on Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha and activate the `collate` feature to participate in the ecosystem as collator candidates. To do this, you can checkout the [Run a Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation and spin up a node using either [Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/){target=\_blank} or [Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/){target=\_blank}.

## Join the Discord {: #join-discord }

As a collator, it is important to keep track of updates and changes to configuration. It is also important to be able to easily contact us and vice versa in case there is any issue with your node, as that will not only negatively affect collator and delegator rewards, it will also negatively affect the network.

For this purpose, we use [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/moonbeam){target=\_blank}. The most relevant Discord channels for collators are the following:

 - **tech-upgrades-announcements** — here we will publish any updates or changes in configuration changes collators will be required to follow. We will also announce any technical issues to monitor, such as network stalls
 - **collators** — this is the general collator discussion channel. We are proud of having an active and friendly collator community so if you have any questions, this is the place to ask. We will also ping collators here for any issues that require their attention.
 - **meet-the-collators** — in this channel you can introduce yourself to potential delegators

After you join our Discord, feel free to DM *gilmouta* or *artkaseman* and introduce yourself. This will let us know who to contact if we see an issue with your node, and will also let us assign the relevant Discord collator role, enabling you to post in *meet-the-collators*.

# Run a Node on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Running a full node on a Moonbeam-based network allows you to connect to the network, sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, author blocks on the parachain, and more.

There are multiple deployments of Moonbeam, including the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, Moonriver on Kusama, and Moonbeam on Polkadot. Here's how these environments are named and their corresponding [chain specification file](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/deployment/generate-chain-specs/) names:

|    Network     |      Hosted By      |             Chain Name              |
|:--------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| Moonbase Alpha | Moonbeam Foundation | {{ networks.moonbase.chain_spec }}  |
|   Moonriver    |       Kusama        | {{ networks.moonriver.chain_spec }} |
|    Moonbeam    |      Polkadot       | {{ networks.moonbeam.chain_spec }}  |

!!! note
    Moonbase Alpha is still considered an Alphanet, and as such _will not_ have 100% uptime. The parachain might be purged as needed. During the development of your application, make sure you implement a method to redeploy your contracts and accounts to a fresh parachain quickly. If a chain purge is required, it will be announced via our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX) at least 24 hours in advance.

## Requirements {: #requirements }

Running a parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node is a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself, as well as code to sync the relay chain and facilitate communication between the two. As such, this build is quite large and may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory.

The minimum specs recommended to run a node are shown in the following table. For our Kusama and Polkadot MainNet deployments, disk requirements will be higher as the network grows.

!!! note
    If you don't see an `Imported` message (without the `[Relaychain]` tag) when running a node, you might need to double-check your port configuration.

## Running Ports {: #running-ports }

As stated before, the relay/parachain nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the parachain, while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P. **Collators must not have RPC or WS ports opened**.

!!! note
    As of client v0.33.0, the `--ws-port` and `--ws-max-connections` flags have been deprecated and removed in favor of the `--rpc-port` and `--rpc-max-connections` flags for both RPC and WSS connections. The default port is `9944`, and the default maximum number of connections is set to 100.

### Default Ports for a Parachain Full-Node {: #default-ports-for-a-parachain-full-node }

|  Description   |                Port                 |
|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
|    **P2P**     | {{ networks.parachain.p2p }} (TCP)  |
|  **RPC & WS**  |     {{ networks.parachain.ws }}     |
| **Prometheus** | {{ networks.parachain.prometheus }} |

### Default Ports of Embedded Relay Chain {: #default-ports-of-embedded-relay-chain }

|  Description   |                 Port                  |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------------:|

|  **RPC & WS**  |     {{ networks.relay_chain.ws }}     |
| **Prometheus** | {{ networks.relay_chain.prometheus }} |

## Installation {: #installation }

There are a couple different guides to help you get started running a Moonbeam-based node:

- [Using Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/) - this method provides a quick and easy way to get started with a Docker container
- [Using Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/) - this method is recommended for those with experience compiling a Substrate node

## Debug, Trace and TxPool APIs {: #debug-trace-txpool-apis }

You can also gain access to some non-standard RPC methods by running a tracing node, which allow developers to inspect and debug transactions during runtime. Tracing nodes use a different Docker image than a standard Moonbase Alpha, Moonriver, or Moonbeam node. Check out the [Run a Tracing Node](/node-operators/networks/tracing-node/) guide and be sure to switch to the right network tab throughout the instructions. Then to interact with your tracing node, check out the [Debug & Trace](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/) guide.

## Lazy Loading {: #lazy-loading }

Lazy loading lets a Moonbeam node operate while downloading network state in the background, eliminating the need to wait for full synchronization before use. You can activate lazy loading with the following flag:

- **`--lazy-loading-remote-rpc`** - allows lazy loading by relying on a specified RPC for network state until the node is fully synchronized e.g. `--lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT-RPC-URL'`

Upon spooling up a node with this feature, you'll see output like the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty>[Lazy loading 🌗]
    <br>You are now running the Moonbeam client in lazy loading mode, where data is retrieved
    <br>from a live RPC node on demand.
    <br>Using remote state from: https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com
    <br>Forking from block: 8482853
    <br>To ensure the client works properly, please note the following:
    <br>    1. *Avoid Throttling*: Ensure that the backing RPC node is not limiting the number of
    <br>    requests, as this can prevent the lazy loading client from functioning correctly;
    <br>    2. *Be Patient*: As the client may take approximately 20 times longer than normal to
    <br>    retrieve and process the necessary data for the requested operation.
    <br>The service will start in 10 seconds...</span>
</div>

!!! note
    Lazy loading a Moonbeam requires a large number of RPC requests. To avoid being rate-limited by a public endpoint, it's highly recommended to use a [dedicated endpoint](/builders/get-started/endpoints#endpoint-providers).  

You can further customize your use of the lazy loading functionality with the following optional parameters:

- **`--lazy-loading-block`** - specifies a block hash from which to start loading data. If not provided, the latest block will be used
- **`--lazy-loading-delay-between-requests`** - the delay (in milliseconds) between RPC requests when using lazy loading. This parameter controls the amount of time to wait between consecutive RPC requests. This can help manage request rate and avoid overwhelming the server. Default value is `100` milliseconds
- **`--lazy-loading-max-retries-per-request`** - the maximum number of retries for an RPC request when using lazy loading. Default value is `10` retries
- **`--lazy-loading-runtime-override`** - path to a WASM file to override the runtime when forking. If not provided, it will fetch the runtime from the block being forked
- **`--lazy-loading-state-overrides`** - path to a JSON file containing state overrides to be applied when forking 

The state overrides file should define the respective pallet, storage item, and value that you seek to override as follows:

```json
[
 {
     "pallet": "System",
     "storage": "SelectedCandidates",
     "value": "0x04f24ff3a9cf04c71dbc94d0b566f7a27b94566cac"
 }
]
```

## Logs and Troubleshooting {: #logs-and-troubleshooting }

You will see logs from both the relay chain and the parachain. The relay chain will be prefixed by `[Relaychain]`, while the parachain has no prefix.

### P2P Ports Not Open {: #p2p-ports-not-open }

If you don't see an `Imported` message (without the `[Relaychain]` tag), you need to check the P2P port configuration. P2P port must be open to incoming traffic.

### In Sync {: #in-sync }

Both chains must be in sync at all times, and you should see either `Imported` or `Idle` messages and have connected peers.

### Genesis Mismatching {: #genesis-mismatching }

The Moonbase Alpha TestNet may need to be purged and upgraded once in a while. Consequently, you may see the following message:

```text
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id `ID` is on a different
chain (our genesis: GENESIS_ID theirs: OTHER_GENESIS_ID)
```

This typically means that you are running an older version and will need to upgrade.

We announce the upgrades (and corresponding chain purge) via our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX) at least 24 hours in advance.

Instructions for purging chain data will vary slightly depending on how you spun up your node:

  - For Docker, you can check out the [Purge Your Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/#purge-your-node) section of the [Using Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/) page

# How to List your Project on the Moonbeam DApp Directory

## Introduction to the Moonbeam DApp Directory {: #introduction-to-state-of-the-dapps }

The Moonbeam ecosystem comprises two distinct production networks: Moonbeam and Moonriver. Each network has its own dedicated [DApp Directory](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam/app-dir){target=\_blank}, maintained by the Moonbeam Foundation. These directories categorize projects spanning from DeFi to NFTs to gaming, providing users with comprehensive access to diverse applications.

You'll supply core project details like name, description, and relevant links when adding your project. Depending on your project type, you may include additional data such as on-chain stats and token information.

Despite the distinction between the Moonbeam and Moonriver DApp directories, the submission process remains the same. To list your project on the DApp Directory, you must submit a pull request to the [Moonbeam Foundation's App Directory Data repository on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank}. This guide outlines the necessary data and formatting specifics for your submission.

![The Moonbeam DApp Directory home page](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-1.webp)

## Overview of the Project Data {: #overview-project-data }

There are four main sources of data that are used for a project's listing in the Moonbeam DApp Directory:

- **Core Project Data** - core project data such as descriptions, logos, and screenshots. This data also includes IDs used to query data from external platforms
- **Active Users and Transaction Volume** - on-chain data based on smart contract activity for all of the contracts associated with the project. Data is discovered via the use of contract labeling in Moonscan, which is then indexed by Web3Go and consumed by the DApp Directory
- **TVL Data** - TVL data for the protocol, sourced from the project's listing on DefiLlama
- **Project Token Information** - token information, which is sourced from the project's listing on CoinGecko

## Prerequisites for Using External Data Sources {: #configuring-external-data-sources }

Before pulling data from the mentioned sources, certain prerequisites must be fulfilled. However, it's worth noting that these steps may not apply to all project types. For instance, in the case of wallets, where there are no smart contracts, the DApp Directory is currently unable to display user and transaction activity data.

### Configure the Data Source for Active Users and Transaction Volume {: #configure-active-users }

For projects that have smart contracts deployed on Moonbeam or Moonriver, it is important that those contracts can be linked to the DApp Directory project data.

The end-to-end flow for linking smart contract activity to the DApp Directory is as follows:

1. The smart contract owner fills in the [form to label contracts on Moonscan](https://moonscan.io/contactus?id=5){target=\_blank}
2. The contracts become labeled in Moonscan
3. Periodically, the entire list of labeled contracts is exported and transmitted to Web3Go to be ingested
4. Every hour, Web3Go loads smart contract activity within Moonbeam and Moonriver and runs a job to index this data by the labels

To get your project's smart contracts properly labeled on [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank}, please refer to Web3Go's documentation on the [Labeling Structure](https://dinlol.gitbook.io/moonscan-smart-contract-label-for-projects/labeling-structure){target=\_blank} and [How to Submit Contract Information](https://dinlol.gitbook.io/moonscan-smart-contract-label-for-projects/how-to-submit-contract-information){target=\_blank} on Moonscan.

Once you've labeled your smart contracts and are ready to submit your project to the DApp Directory, configuring the Directory to utilize your smart contract data becomes straightforward. You'll only need the **Project** component of your labeled contracts.

Consider the following example project with two smart contracts: a Comptroller and a Router recently updated to a new version.

|  Project   | Contract Name | Contract Version |      Resulting Label       |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------------:|
| My Project |  Comptroller  |        V1        | My Project: Comptroller V1 |
| My Project |    Router     |        V2        |   My Project: Router V2    |

To submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, ensure you have your **Project** name ready, identified here as `My Project`.

If you're ready to add your project to the DApp Directory, skip to the [How to Submit Your Project Listing](#how-to-submit-your-project-listing) section.

### Configure the Data Source for TVL {: #configure-tvl }

If the project represents a DeFi protocol with TVL (whereby value is locked in the protocol's smart contract), it is possible to display TVL in the Moonbeam DApp Directory.

TVL data is pulled from [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com){target=\_blank}, so you must list your project there. To get your project listed, please refer to DefiLlama's documentation on [How to list a DeFi project](https://docs.llama.fi/list-your-project/submit-a-project){target=\_blank}.

After listing your project, you can easily configure the DApp Directory to pull data from DefiLlama. To do so, you'll need the DefiLlama identifier, which you can find in the URL for your protocol's page. For example, the URL for Moonwell's page is `https://defillama.com/protocol/moonwell`, so the identifier is `moonwell`.

If you have the identifier and are ready to submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, skip to the [How to Submit Your Project Listing](#how-to-submit-your-project-listing) section.

### Configure the Data Source for Project Token Information {: #project-token-information }

If a project has a token, it is possible to display the name of the token, current price, and contract in the DApp Directory.

However, the data is pulled from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com){target=\_blank}, so the project's token must be listed there. If your token is not listed there, you can complete [CoinGecko's Request Form](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/requests/new){target=\_blank} to initiate the listing process.

Assuming your project's token is listed there, you must obtain the CoinGecko **API ID** value. You can find the **API ID** value in the **Information** section of the token's page on CoinGecko. For example, the **API ID** on [Moonwell's token page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonwell){target=\_blank} is `moonwell-artemis`.

If you have the CoinGecko ID and are ready to submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, you can continue to the next section.

## How to Submit Your Project Listing {: #how-to-submit-your-project-listing }

As mentioned, you must submit a pull request to the Moonbeam Foundation's GitHub repository that holds the DApp Directory's data. Before getting started, it's worth noting that to expedite the review process, the GitHub user who submits the pull request is recommended to be a major contributor to the project's GitHub so that the Moonbeam Foundation can quickly verify that they represent the project. You can check out the [Review Process](#review-process) section for more information.

To begin, you have two options for adding your project information to the [`app-directory-data` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){targe\_blank}. You can utilize [GitHub's browser-based editor](https://github.dev/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank}, which offers a user-friendly interface.

![The app-directory-data repository loaded on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-2.webp)

Or you can clone the repository locally and make modifications using your preferred code editor, in which you can use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data.git
```

Once you've cloned the project, you can create a new branch to which you will add all of your changes. To do this on the browser-based editor, take the following steps:

1. Click on the current branch name in the bottom left corner
2. A menu will appear at the top of the page. Enter the name of your branch
3. Click **Create new branch...**

![Create a new branch on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-3.webp)

The page will reload, and your branch name will now be displayed in the bottom left corner.

### Projects with Deployments on Moonbeam and Moonriver {: #projects-with-deployments }

If a project is deployed to both Moonbeam and Moonriver, there are two different options available:

- Create a separate project structure for each deployment
- Use a single project structure and modify the project data file for both projects

Separate project structures should be used if:

- The two deployments have distinct representations in DefiLlama (i.e., two distinct identifiers)
- The project has two different tokens, one native to Moonbeam and one native to Moonriver

Otherwise, either option may be used.

### Set Up the Folder Structure for Your Project {: #set-up-the-file-structure }

All configurations for each project listed in the DApp Directory are stored in the `projects` folder.

To get started, you must have a name that uniquely and properly identifies your project. Using your project name, you can take the following steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project using your unique project name
2. In your project directory, you'll need to create:
    1. A project data file is a JSON file that defines all your project data and contains references to the images stored in the `logos` and `screenshots` folders. The list of fields you can use to define your data, with descriptions, is outlined in the next section. The file must be named using your unique project name
    2. A `logos` folder where your project logo images are stored
    3. (Optional) A `screenshots` folder where screenshots for the project are stored

??? code "Example folder structure"

    ```text
    my-project
├── my-project.json
├── logos
│   ├── my-project-logo-small.jpeg
│   └── my-project-logo-full.jpeg
└── screenshots
    ├── my-project-screenshot1-small.jpeg
    ├── my-project-screenshot1-full.jpeg
    ├── my-project-screenshot2-small.jpeg
    └── my-project-screenshot2-full.jpeg
    ```

![The file structure displayed on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-4.webp)

With the foundational file structure in place, you're ready to populate the necessary information for your project submission.

### Add Information to the Project Data File {: #add-information }

Your project's data file is where you'll add all the information for your project. The file permits the following top-level properties:

| <div style="width:10vw">Property</div> |                         Type                          |                                                                                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                                                                                       |

It should be a unique, human-readable string representing this project. E.g., `my-project`                                                                                                |
|                 `slug`                 |                        String                         |                                                  Identifier used in certain third-party sources. In particular, if the project is listed in DefiLlama, this value should be set to the DefiLlama identifier. See the [Configure the Data Source for TVL](#configure-tvl) section for more information                                                  |

#### URLs {: #urls }

The `urls` property name/value pairs are used so a project can provide links to their website, socials, etc.

The following table lists the supported `urls` properties:

| Property Name |                                                    Description                                                     |                     Example                     |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|
|   `website`   |                                          The main website for the project                                          |            https://moonbeam.network/            |
|     `try`     | URL a user should visit if they want to try out the dApp. Typically, this page will have a link to launch the dApp |            https://moonbeam.network/            |
|   `twitter`   |                                           The project's Twitter profile                                            |       https://twitter.com/MoonbeamNetwork       |
|   `medium`    |                                             The project's Medium site                                              |       https://medium.com/moonbeam-network       |
|  `telegram`   |                                               The project's Telegram                                               |         https://t.me/Moonbeam_Official          |
|   `github`    |                                          The project's GitHub repository                                           | https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam |
|   `discord`   |                                               The project's Discord                                                |       https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX        |

The format of the property name/value pairs should follow the JSON standard, for example:

```json
"urls": {
    "website": "https://moonbeam.network/",
    "try": "https://docs.moonbeam.network/",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/MoonbeamNetwork"
}
```

#### Logos {: #logos }

The `logos` property of the main project data file is a map of image sizes (i.e., `small`, `large`, `full`) to corresponding image JSON objects. The image JSON object contains the display properties for the given image.

The following table lists the properties of the image JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                                                       Description                                                                        |
|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `fileName` | String |                                         The name of the image file (unqualified) stored in the `logos` directory                                         |
|  `width`   |  int   |                                                          The width of the logo image in pixels                                                           |
|  `height`  |  int   |                                                          The height of the logo image in pixels                                                          |
| `mimeType` | String | The standard [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types){target=\_blank} of the file. E.g., `"image/jpeg"` |

Currently, only the `small` size is utilized, and the dimensions for small logos should be 40x40 pixels.

Here is an example showing the structure of the `logo` property that supplies `small` and `full` logos:

```json
"logo": {
    "small": {
        "fileName": "my-project-logo-small.jpeg",
        "width": 40,
        "height": 40,
        "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
    },
    "full": {
        "fileName": "my-project-logo-full.jpeg",
        "width": 3000,
        "height": 3000,
        "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
    }
}
```

#### Screenshots {: #screenshots }

The `screenshots` property of the main project data file is an array of maps. Each map in the array is for a specific screenshot.

However, different-sized images for each screenshot should be supplied so that different sizes can be used in different contexts (e.g., thumbnails vs full-sized images). Thus, for each screenshot, there is a map of image sizes (i.e., `small`, `large`, `full`) to corresponding image JSON objects. The image JSON object contains the display properties for the given image.

The following table lists the properties of the image JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                                                       Description                                                                        |
|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `fileName` | String |                                      The name of the image file (unqualified) stored in the `screenshots` directory                                      |
|  `width`   |  int   |                                                          The width of the logo image in pixels                                                           |
|  `height`  |  int   |                                                          The height of the logo image in pixels                                                          |
| `mimeType` | String | The standard [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types){target=\_blank} of the file. E.g., `"image/jpeg"` |

Here is an example showing the structure of the `screenshot` property for two screenshots (`screenshot1` and `screenshot2`):

```json
"screenshots": [
    {
        "small": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot1-small.png",
            "width": 429,
            "height": 200,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        },
        "full": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot1-full.png",
            "width": 514,
            "height": 300,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        }
    },
    {
        "small": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot2-small.png",
            "width": 429,
            "height": 200,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        },
        "full": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot2-full.png",
            "width": 1716,
            "height": 800,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        }
    }
]
```

#### Contracts {: #contracts }

A list of contracts for the project. Currently, this is used only for token contracts.

The smart contracts that make up the protocol are sourced from [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank} based on tagging, so they do not need to be listed here. If you have not properly labeled your contracts or are unsure if they are labeled according to the Moonbeam community standard, please refer to the [Configure the Data Source for Active Users and Transaction Volume](#configure-active-users) section.

The following table lists the properties found in the contract JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                  Description                                  |
|:----------:|:------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `contract` | String |                      The address for the smart contract                       |
|  `chain`   | String | The chain on which the contract is deployed (i.e., `moonbeam` or `moonriver`) |
|   `name`   | String |                           The name of the contract                            |

Here is a `contracts` array with a single smart contract for the WGLMR token:

```json
"contracts": [
    {
        "contract": "0xAcc15dC74880C9944775448304B263D191c6077F",
        "chain": "moonbeam",
        "name": "Wrapped GLMR Token"
    }
]
```

### Submit a Pull Request {: #submit-a-pull-request }

After you've populated the project data file and added your logos and screenshots, you should be ready to submit your pull request.

![All of the project files added on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-5.webp)

From the web-based editor, take the following steps to commit your changes to the `app-directory-data` repository:

1. Click on the **Source Control** tab, which should show you how many pages have been added or changed
2. Review the files under the **Changes** section. Click the **+** button next to **Changes**, or as you review each file, click the **+** button next to the file name to add them to the list of **Staged Changes**

![Staging the changed files on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-6.webp)

All of your files should now be under the **Staged Changes** section. All you have to commit and push the changes are:

1. Enter a descriptive commit message, such as "Add My Project", making sure to use your actual project name
2. Click **Commit & Push**

![Committing the staged files on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-7.webp)

Now that you've committed the changes, you'll need to head over to the [`app-directory-data` repository](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank} and open a pull request against the `develop` branch:

1. At the top of the repository page, click **Compare and Pull** button displayed on the banner, or
2. If the banner is not there anymore, you'll need to select your branch from the branches dropdown
3. Click the **Contribute** dropdown
4. Click the **Open pull request** button

![The main page of the app-directory-data repository on GitHub](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-8.webp)

You'll be taken to the **Comparing changes** page, where you'll need to:

1. Make sure that you are merging your branch into the `develop` branch, which is the **base** branch
2. Add a title
3. Add a description of the changes
4. Click **Create pull request**

![Submit a pull request on the Comparing changes page of the app-directory-data repository on GitHub](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-9.webp)

### The Review Process {: #review-process }

Submitted pull requests will be reviewed bi-weekly by the Moonbeam Foundation. During the review, and especially for new projects, the Foundation may have to verify that the GitHub user who created the pull request is a contributor and/or represents the specific project. One way projects can expedite this process is if the submitter's GitHub account is also a major contributor to the project itself on GitHub. Alternatively, teams should leave a note in the pull request comments indicating how we can get in touch with project team members to verify.

A comment will be added to the pull request if any changes are requested. After your pull request has been approved, it will be merged, and your project will be added to the Moonbeam DApp Directory!

## How to Update Your Project Listing {: #how-to-update-your-project-listing }

As your project evolves, you may need to update your project's listing or images related to your listing. You can create a new branch for your changes, find and modify your existing project's data from the root `projects` directory, and make the desired changes.

If you are no longer using a logo or screenshot, please remember to remove it from the `logos` or `screenshots` directory.

Once your changes have been made, you must follow the same instructions in the [Submit a Pull Request](#submit-a-pull-request) section so the changes can be [reviewed](#review-process) by the Moonbeam Foundation. Please note that pull requests are reviewed on a bi-weekly basis, so if the update is urgent, you can create a [forum post](https://forum.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} asking for assistance.

## DApp Directory API {: #dapp-directory-api }

The DApp Directory also features a queryable API that you can use to integrate data from Moonbeam's DApp Directory into your application. The API is public and currently does not require authentication. The base URL for the API is as follows:

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/
```

### Query a Project {: #query-a-project}

You can retrieve all the information for a particular project by appending `/projects/INSERT_PROJECT_NAME` to the base URL. If you need clarification on the project name, you can omit the project name as shown below to retrieve data for every listed project and find the project in the response. 

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects
```

Here's an example of querying the API for StellaSwap, which returns the project description, social media information, user counts, relevant smart contract addresses, market data, images, and more. 

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects/stellaswap
```

You can visit the query URL directory in the browser, using a tool like Postman, or directly from the command line with Curl as follows: 

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET 'https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects/stellaswap'
```

??? code "API Response to Querying StellaSwap"

            "description":"A long time ago the Fortune’s Grasp was carrying families to settle on The Islands and start a new life. In the middle of their voyage they encountered a fearsome maelstrom. The Captain and his crew worked tirelessly to keep the ship afloat. Badly damaged, the Ship limped to the edges of the storm. It was taking on water and the cries of terrified children could be heard above the crashing waves. Another ship appeared on the horizon, it’s light glowing brightly against the dark night. The Captain of the Fortune’s Grasp ordered his crew to evacuate the families, but the fifty crew members ignored the Captain, abandoning ship, taking all means of escape with them. The Captain, left on the sinking ship, cursed the cowardly crew for damning those innocent souls to the watery depths. Those Forsaken Fifty were marked with The Black Spot, doomed to row the high seas until the Reaper came to claim his mutinous crew to serve on the Ship Of The Damned. However, if they could convince another soul to take their place at the oars, protection would be offered by those Pirates who’ve cheated the Reaper before. Those who’ve served and survived are welcome in the Damned Pirates Society.\r\n\r\nThe Damned Pirate Society is an Profile Picture NFT with inbuilt utility.

# Glossary

There's a great deal of terminology that's specific to Polkadot, Substrate, and the emerging Parity/Web3 ecosystem. We've compiled a list of terms we think you'll want to know as you review the Moonbeam documentation, plans, and tutorials.

### Collators {: #collators }

One of the key network participants needed to support parachains within the Polkadot Network.  In Moonbeam, collators are the nodes that are responsible for block production and for submitting produced blocks up to the Polkadot relay chain for finalization.

### Delegators {: #delegators }

Moonbeam token holders who stake tokens, vouching for specific collator candidates on the parachain. Any user that holds a minimum amount of tokens as [free balance](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-accounts/#balance-types#balance-types){target=\_blank} can become a delegator by staking their tokens.

### Nominators {: #nominators }

Relay chain token holders who select to "back" a validator. They can receive part of the validator's reward, but are subject to slashing of their staked tokens in case the validator misbehaves. A nominator can back up to 16 validators, and their bond is fully distributed between the backed validators that were selected for the validator set.

### Nominated Proof of Stake {: #nominated-proof-of-stake }

The mechanism used by Polkadot for selecting its block validator set to maximize chain security. At its core, it is a Proof-of-Stake system (PoS) in which nominators back validators. The latter with the highest backing are selected to be part of the validator set for a session. The stake of a validator is slashed in case of misbehavior. Thus, nominators are expected to do due diligence on the validators they nominate.

### Parachains {: #parachains }

A blockchain which has a slot and is connected to Polkadot. Parachains receive shared security from Polkadot and the ability to interact with other parachains on the Polkadot network. They must lock DOT, the native relay chain token, to secure a slot for a specific period (up two years).

### Parathreads {: #parathreads }

A blockchain which can connect to Polkadot.  Parathreads are able to interact with other members of the Polkadot network, but they bid for block finalization (in DOT) on a block-to-block basis. They compete with other parathreads for block finalization, meaning that the block with the highest bid is selected to be finalize in that round.

### Polkadot {: #polkadot }

A network of connected blockchains that provides shared security and the ability to interact between chains.  Polkadot is built using the Substrate development framework.  Chains that connect to Polkadot are called parachains.

### Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

The backbone blockchain supporting the Polkadot network.  Parachains connect to the relay chain and use it for shared security and message passing.  Validators on the relay chain help secure the parachains.

### Smart Contract {: #smart-contract }

A [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract){target=\_blank} is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control, or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. Smart contracts intend to reduce the need for trusted intermediators, arbitrations, and enforcement costs, as well as reduce fraud losses and malicious and accidental exceptions.

### Substrate {: #substrate }

A Rust-based blockchain development framework created by Parity Technologies based on their experience implementing multiple blockchain clients.  Substrate comes with many modules and functionalities that are needed when building a blockchain, including P2P networking, consensus mechanisms, staking, cryptocurrency, on-chain governance modules, and more.  It dramatically reduces the time and engineering effort required to implement a blockchain. Substrate is now part of the [Polkadot SDK](https://polkadot.com/platform/sdk/){target=\_blank}.

### Substrate Frame Pallets {: #substrate-frame-pallets }

Substrate Frame Pallets are a collection of Rust-based modules, providing the functionality required for building a blockchain.  

### Validators {: #validators }

A node that secures the Polkadot relay chain by staking DOT in the network, which is slashed if they misbehave. They finalize blocks from collators on parachains and also participate on consensus for the next relay chain block with other validators.

### WebAssembly/Wasm {: #webassemblywasm }

WebAssembly is an open standard that defines a portable binary code format. It is supported by different programming languages, compilers, and browsers.

# Historical Updates

## Introduction {: #introduction }

This page overviews historical updates on Moonbeam and Moonriver, such as bug fixes to the Moonbeam source code and data migrations applied.

This page aims to provide information about unexpected behaviors or data inconsistencies associated with updates that require forced data migrations.

## Bugs {: #bugs }

#### Invalid Transactions Stored {: #invalid-transactions-stored }

For invalid transactions where the transaction cost couldn't be paid, the EVM pallet inserted the transaction metadata into storage instead of discarding it because there was no transaction cost validation. As a result, the runtime storage was unnecessarily bloated with invalid transaction data.

This bug only impacted Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----:|:--------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT600 |      0 - 455106      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT600 |      0 - 675175      |

#### Ethereum Fees Weren't Sent to Treasury {: #ethereum-fees-to-treasury }

The Moonbeam transaction fee model before Runtime 3401 and the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank} mandated a 20% allocation of fees sent to the on-chain Treasury and 80% burned as a deflationary force. However, before runtime 800, Ethereum transactions did not correctly allocate 20% of the transaction fees to the on-chain Treasury.

This bug only impacted Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----:|:--------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT800 |      0 - 684728      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT800 |      0 - 915684      |

For more information, you can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/732){target=\_blank}.

---

#### Missing Refunds {: #missing-refunds }

Moonbeam is configured to set the existential deposit to 0, meaning that accounts do not need a minimum balance to be considered active. For Substrate-based chains with this configuration, some refunds were missing from zeroed accounts because the account was interpreted as not existing.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT1001 |       0 - 5164       |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT1001 |     0 - 1052241      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT1001 |     0 - 1285915      |

For more information, you can review the [relative Frontier PR](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/pull/509){target=\_blank} and the associated [Substrate PR on GitHub](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/10117){target=\_blank}.

#### Incorrect Collator Selection {: #incorrect-collator-selection }

The total delegations for collator candidates were not correctly updated when a delegation was increased via the `delegatorBondMore` extrinsic. This led to issues where the increased delegation amount wasn't included in the candidates' total amount bonded, which is used to determine which candidates are in the active set of collators. As a result, some candidates may not have been selected to be in the active set when they should have been, impacting their own and their delegators' rewards.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT1300 |      0 - 524762      |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT1300 |     0 - 1541735      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT1300 |     0 - 1761128      |

#### New Account Event Bug {: #new-account-event }

The `System.NewAccount` event is emitted when a new account is created. However, a bug prevented this event from being emitted for some accounts at creation time. A hotfix was applied that patched the impacted accounts and emitted the `System.NewAccount` at a later time.

The hotfix was applied in the following block ranges:

|    Network     |                                                              Block Range                                                              |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    | [1041355 - 1041358 and 1100752](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/extrinsic?module=evm&call=hotfix_inc_account_sufficients){target=\_blank} |
|   Moonriver    |      [1835760 - 1835769](https://moonriver.subscan.io/extrinsic?module=evm&call=hotfix_inc_account_sufficients){target=\_blank}       |
| Moonbase Alpha |  [2097782 - 2097974](https://moonbase.subscan.io/extrinsic?address=&module=evm&call=hotfix_inc_account_sufficients){target=\_blank}   |

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT1401 |      0 - 915320      |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT1401 |     0 - 1705939      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT1400 |     0 - 1962557      |

For more information, you can review the [relative Frontier PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/frontier/pull/46/files){target=\_blank}.

#### Incorrect Timestamp Units {: #incorrect-timestamp-units }

EIP-2612 and Ethereum blocks deal with timestamps in seconds; however, the Substrate timestamp pallet that Moonbeam implements uses milliseconds. This only affected the EIP-2612 implementation, not the `block.timestamp` value.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT1606 |     0 - 1326697      |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT1605 |     0 - 2077598      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT1603 |     0 - 2285346      |

For more information, you can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/1451){target=\_blank}.

#### Substrate Tips Missing Treasury Distribution {: #substrate-tips }

Tips for Substrate-based transactions weren't handled properly. The entire portion of the tip was burned because it was not handled in the runtime code. A fix was applied so that 20% was paid to the Treasury and 80% was burned, consistent with all other fee behavior at that time.

Note that RT3401 introduced a parameters pallet fee configuration allowing governance to adjust how fees are split between the Treasury and burning. After this runtime upgrade combined with the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank}, 100% of all transaction fees on both Moonbeam and Moonriver are now burned.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT2403 |     0 - 4163078      |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT2401 |     0 - 4668844      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT2401 |     0 - 4591616      |

For more information, you can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/2291){target=\_blank}.

#### Incorrect Delegation Reward Calculation {: #incorrect-delegation-reward-calculation }

The reward payouts for all delegations and collators were underestimated whenever there were pending requests. Delegation rewards are calculated based on the amount of tokens bonded by each delegator with respect to the total stake of the given collator. By counting delegation amounts for pending requests, the rewards to collators and their delegations were less than they should have been.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1001   | RT1802 |    5165 - 1919457    |
|   Moonriver    |   RT1001   | RT1801 |  1052242 - 2572555   |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1001   | RT1800 |  1285916 - 2748785   |

You can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/1719){target=\_blank} for more information.

#### Block Parent Hash Calculated Incorrectly {: #block-parent-hash-calculated-incorrectly }

After EIP-1559 support was introduced, which included the transition to new Ethereum transaction types, the block header parent hash was miscalculated to `H256::default`.

This bug only impacted Moonbase Alpha and only impacted the following block:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------:|
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1200   | RT1201 |    1648995     |

While the root issue was fixed in RT1201, the incorrect hash was corrected in RT2601.

For more information on the root fix, you can review the [relative Frontier PR on GitHub](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/pull/570/){target=\_blank}. To take a look at the correction of the parent hash, check out the corresponding [Moonbeam PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/2524){target=\_blank}.

---

#### Incorrect Handling of EIP-1559 Gas Fees {: #incorrect-gas-fees-eip1559 }

With the introduction of EIP-1559 support, the logic for handling `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` was implemented incorrectly. As a result, the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` was added to the `baseFee` even if the total amount was over the `maxFeePerGas`.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1201   | RT1401 |   415946 - 915320    |
|   Moonriver    |   RT1201   | RT1401 |  1471037 - 1705939   |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1200   | RT1400 |  1648994 - 1962557   |

For more information, you can review the [relative Frontier PR](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/frontier/pull/45){target=\_blank}.

#### Transaction Fees Paid to Collators {: #transaction-fees-paid-to-collators }

For blocks that included EIP-1559 transactions where a priority fee was applied, the transaction fees were incorrectly calculated and distributed to the block's collator. The fee model on Moonbeam for transactions and smart contract execution was previously handled so that 20% of the fees went to the on-chain Treasury and 80% were burned as a deflationary force. Due to this bug, the transaction fees of the impacted transactions were not burned as expected.

Note that RT3401 introduced a parameters pallet fee configuration allowing governance to adjust how fees are split between the Treasury and burning. After this runtime upgrade combined with the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank}, 100% of all transaction fees on both Moonbeam and Moonriver are now burned.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1201   | RT1504 |   415946 - 1117309   |
|   Moonriver    |   RT1201   | RT1504 |  1471037 - 1910639   |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1200   | RT1504 |  1648994 - 2221772   |

For more information, you can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/1528){target=\_blank}.

---

#### Incorrect State Root Hash {: #incorrect-state-root-hash }

The state root hash was miscalculated for non-legacy transactions as the transaction-type byte was not considered. With the support of [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930){target=\_blank} and [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank}, the transaction types introduced are `0x01` (1) and `0x02` (2), respectively. These transaction types were omitted from the state root hash calculation.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1201   | RT1701 |   415946 - 1581456   |
|   Moonriver    |   RT1201   | RT1701 |  1471037 - 2281722   |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1200   | RT1700 |  1648994 - 2529735   |

#### Ethereum Transactions Duplicated in Storage {: #ethereum-transactions-duplicated-in-storage }

An upstream bug was introduced to Frontier in the Ethereum Pallet, causing pending transactions that existed during a runtime upgrade to be duplicated in storage across two different blocks. This only impacted the first two blocks after the runtime upgrade in which this bug was introduced.

Only Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha were impacted. The bug was introduced in the following runtimes and affected the following blocks:

|    Network     | Introduced |   Impacted Blocks   |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |   RT1605   | 2077599 and 2077600 |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1603   | 2285347 and 2285348 |

The following transactions were duplicated:

#### Gas Limit Too High for Non-Transactional Calls {: #gas-limit-too-high-for-non-transactional-calls }

When a non-transactional call, such as `eth_call` or `eth_estimateGas`, is made without specifying a gas limit for a past block, the client defaults to using the gas limit multiplier (10x), which causes the gas limit validation to fail as it is validating against an upper bound of the block gas limit. So, if the gas limit is greater than the block gas limit for a given call, a gas limit too high error is returned.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1701   | RT1802 |  1581457 - 1919457   |

#### Remote EVM Calls Return Identical Transaction Hashes {: #remote-evm-calls-return-identical-tx-hashes }

When multiple remote EVM calls were sent from different accounts with the same transaction payload and nonce, the same transaction hash was returned for each call. This was possible because remote EVM calls are executed from a keyless account, so if the senders all had the same nonce and were sending the same transaction object, there was no differentiation in the calculation of the transaction hash. This was fixed by adding a global nonce to the Ethereum XCM Pallet, which is the pallet that makes remote EVM calls possible.

This bug only existed on Moonbase Alpha during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |

#### Gas Estimation Discrepancy {: #gas-estimation-discrepancy }

There was a difference between estimating the gas for a transaction using a non-transaction call, such as `eth_call`, and the execution of it on-chain. The discrepancy occurred because the non-transactional calls were not properly accounting for `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, as such, the ([Proof of Validity](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/glossary/#proof-of-validity){target=\_blank}) consumed by the Ethereum transaction was counted differently. This was fixed by properly accounting for these fields when estimating the size of the on-chain transaction.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

#### Incorrect Effective Gas Price In Transaction Receipts {: #incorrect-effective-gas-price }

The `effectiveGasPrice` value returned by `eth_getTransactionReceipt` was different from the on-chain value due to an incorrect calculation of the base fee. Specifically, the transaction receipt's value was computed using the `NextFeeMultiplier` from the block in which the transaction was included rather than the previous block, which is the correct source for computing the base fee.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1201   | RT2801 |   415946 - 5899847   |

#### Skipped Ethereum Transaction Traces {: #skipped-ethereum-transaction-traces }

Runtimes with the `evm-tracing` feature enabled introduced additional `ref_time` overhead due to special logic that traces Ethereum transactions (emitting events for each component: gasometer, runtime, EVM) used to fill information for RPC calls like `debug_traceTransaction` and `trace_filter`. 

Since the real `ref_time` in production runtimes is smaller, this could cause the block weight limits to be reached when replaying a block in an EVM-tracing runtime, resulting in skipped transaction traces. This was observed in Moonbeam block [9770044](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/block/9770044){target=\_blank}.

The fix consisted of resetting the previously consumed weight before tracing each Ethereum transaction. It's important to note that this issue only affected code under `evm-tracing`, which is not included in any production runtime.

This bug was fixed in the following runtime:

|    Network     | Fixed  | Impacted Block |

|    Moonbeam    | RT3501 |    9770044     |

#### Notify Inactive Collator Fails for Long-Inactive Collators {: #notify-inactive-collator-fails }

The `notifyInactiveCollator` extrinsic, designed to remove collators from the pool if they haven't produced any blocks in the last two rounds, failed for collators who had been inactive for significantly longer than two rounds. The transaction would only succeed within the first few blocks of a new round.

The bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |

### EVM Pallet {: evm-pallet }
#### EVM Contract Metadata
A migration was introduced to automate the manual process of setting EVM contract metadata for contracts deployed more than two years ago that hadn't been interacted with after the introduction of metadata storage item. This migration replaces the need to manually call `createContractMetadata(address)` on these contracts to make them compatible with the current runtime. 

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

### Parachain Staking Pallet {: #parachain-staking }

#### Update Collator State Storage Item {: #update-collator-state-storage-item }

A migration was applied that updated the `Collator` storage item of the parachain staking pallet to the new `Collator2` storage item. This change updated the collator state to include the following items:

- The `nominators` set is a list of all of the nominator (delegator) account IDs without their respective balance bonded
- A new `top_nominators` storage item that returns a list of all of the top nominators ordered by greatest bond amount to least
- A new `bottom_nominators` storage item that returns a list of all of the bottom nominators ordered by least bond amount to greatest
- The `total` storage item was replaced with `total_counted` and `total_backing`. The `total_counted` item returns the sum of the top nominations and the collator's self-bond, whereas the `total_backing` item returns the sum of all of the nominations and the collator's self-bond

This migration was only applied to Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|   Moonriver    |       RT53       |     9696      |

#### Support Delayed Nominator (Delegator) Exits {: #support-delayed-nominator-exits }

The exit queue for handling candidate exits had been updated to include support for delayed nominator (delegator) exits and revocations, which required a migration to update the `ExitQueue` parachain staking pallet storage item to `ExitQueue2`. The `NominatorState` storage item was also migrated to `NominatorState2` to prevent a nominator from performing more nominations when they already have scheduled an exit.

These migrations were only applied to Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|

#### Support Manual Exits and DPoS Terminology {: #support-manual-exits-dpos-terminology }

The parachain staking pallet was updated to include manual exits. If a candidate or delegator wanted to decrease or revoke their bond or leave the candidate or delegator pool, they would need to schedule a request first, wait for a delay period to pass, and then manually execute the request. As such, a migration was applied to replace the automatic exit queue, including the `ExitQueue2` storage item, with a manual exits API.

In addition, a change was made to switch from Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) terminology; this marked the sweeping change from "nominate" to "delegate". This required the migration of the following parachain staking pallet storage items:

- `CollatorState2` was migrated to `CandidateState`
- `NominatorState2` was migrated to `DelegatorState`

These migrations were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1001      |     5165      |

#### Split Candidate Delegations into Top and Bottom {: #split-candidate-delegations-top-bottom }

This migration splits the deprecated `CandidateState` storage item of the parachain staking pallet into the following three new storage items to avoid unnecessary storage reads:

- `CandidateInfo`
- `TopDelegations`
- `BottomDelegations`

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

#### Auto-Compounding Support {: #auto-compounding-support }

To support auto-compounding, two migrations were applied to the `AtStake` storage item in the parachain staking pallet:

- `RemovePaidRoundsFromAtStake` - to remove any stale `AtStake` entries relating to already paid-out rounds with candidates that didn't produce any blocks. This migration is a prerequisite for the `MigrateAtStakeAutoCompound` migration
- `MigrateAtStakeAutoCompound` - migrates the snapshots for unpaid rounds for `AtStake` entries

These migrations were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

#### Renaming of Parachain Bond Reserve Events {: #renaming-of-parachain-bond-reserve-events }

Prior to Runtime 3300, the `ReservedForParachainBond` event was emitted once per round to indicate parachain bond reserve funding through inflation. In Runtime 3300, this same event was renamed to `InflationDistributed`.

This change took effect at the following runtimes and blocks:

### Referenda Pallet {: #referenda-pallet }

#### Refunds for Submission Deposits {: #refunds-for-submission-deposits }

A migration was introduced to support refunds for submission deposits on closed referenda that updated the `ReferendumInfo` type. The following invariants of `ReferendumInfo` were changed so that the second parameter, `Deposit<AccountId, Balance>`, is now optional, `Option<Deposit<AccountId, Balance>>`: `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Cancelled`, and `TimedOut`.

This stemmed from an upstream change to the [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12788){target=\_blank} repository.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |

#### Restore Corrupted Referenda Deposits {: restore-corrupted-referenda-deposits }

A migration was introduced to support restoring referenda deposits affected by corrupted storage values. The issue arose when a migration was applied twice due to a pallet version error, resulting in invalid values and non-refundable submission deposits. As the number of values to correct was finite and small, this migration created a list to update them by hand.

This migration was only applied to Moonbeam and was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

| Network  | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| Moonbeam |      RT3100      |    7303601    |

### XCM-Related Pallets {: #xcm-related-pallets }

#### Update Transact Info Storage Item {: #update-transaction-info }

There was a migration applied to the `TransactInfo` storage item of the XCM Transactor Pallet that changed the following items:

- `max_weight` is added to prevent transactors from stalling the queue in the destination chain
- Removes `fee_per_byte`, `metadata_size`, and `base_weight` as these items are not necessary for XCM transactions
- `fee_per_second` replaces `fee_per_weight` to better reflect cases (like Kusama) in which the `fee_per_weight` unit is lower than one

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1201      |    415946     |

#### Add Support for Kusama Asset Hub (Statemine) Prefix Breaking Change {: #add-support-statemine-prefix }

The following three migrations were added to the asset manager pallet to avoid issues with Kusama Asset Hub's (previously referred to as Statemine) [breaking change to the way it represents assets](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/831){target=\_blank} and possible future breaking changes:

- `UnitsWithAssetType` - updates the `AssetTypeUnitsPerSecond` storage item to a mapping of the `AssetType` to `units_per_second`, instead of the mapping `AssetId` to `units_per_second`. This is done to avoid additional migrations whenever a breaking change arises
- `PopulateAssetTypeIdStorage` - creates a new `AssetTypeId` storage item that holds the `AssetType` to `AssetId` mapping, which allows the decoupling of `assetIds` and `AssetTypes`
- `ChangeStateminePrefixes` - updates already registered Kusama Asset Hub (Statemine) assets to their new form

These migrations were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1201      |    415946     |

#### Add New Supported Fee Payment Assets Storage Item {: #add-supported-fee-payment-assets }

A migration was applied to the asset manager pallet, creating a new `SupportedFeePaymentAssets` storage item by reading the supported asset data from the `AssetTypeUnitsPerSecond` storage item. This storage item will hold all the assets we accept for XCM fee payment. It will be read when an incoming XCM message is received, and if the asset is not in storage, the message will not be processed.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1300      |    524762     |

#### Update the XCM Transactor Storage from V2 to V3 {: #update-xcm-transactor }

With the support of XCM V3, a migration was applied to update the XCM Transactor pallet's storage from XCM V2 to V3. The `transactInfoWithWeightLimit` and `destinationAssetFeePerSecond` storage items were updated to support XCM V3 multilocations.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT2302      |    3456477    |

#### Remove Mintable XC-20s {: #remove-local-assets }

Mintable XC-20s were deprecated in favor of XCM-enabled ERC-20s; as such, a migration was applied to remove the local assets pallet and clear the assets in storage.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |

#### Manage Foreign Assets via Smart Contracts  {: #foreign-assets-migration }

A migration was applied to transition existing foreign assets to a new design that manages XCM derivative assets on Moonbeam through EVM smart contracts instead of the previous implementation using the Asset and Asset Manager pallets. The migration process involved several extrinsics in the Moonbeam Lazy Migration pallet:

- **`approve_assets_to_migrate`** - sets the list of asset IDs approved for migration
- **`start_foreign_asset_migration`** - initiates migration for a specific foreign asset by freezing the original asset and creating a new EVM smart contract
- **`migrate_foreign_asset_balances`** - migrates asset balances in batches from old assets pallet to the new system
- **`migrate_foreign_asset_approvals`** - migrates asset approvals in batches while unreserving deposits from the old approval system
- **`finish_foreign_asset_migration`** - completes migration after all balances and approvals are migrated and performs final cleanup

This migration preserves compatibility with existing foreign assets by identifying each foreign asset with the same AssetID integer as before. This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|

### Nimbus Author Filter Pallet {: #nimbus }

#### Replace Eligible Ratio with Eligible Count {: #replace-eligible-ratio }

A breaking change was applied to the Nimbus repository, deprecating `EligibleRatio` in favor of the `EligibleCount` config. As a result, a migration was applied to the Moonbeam repository, populating the new `EligibleCount` value as a percentage of the potential authors defined at that block height if the `EligibleRatio` value existed. Otherwise, the value was set to a default value of `50`.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1502      |    1107285    |

# Runtime Upgrades

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam runtime upgrades allow for the maintenance and evolution of the chain logic without the need for a hard fork. These runtime upgrades can introduce new features, improve performance, fix bugs, and respond to changing requirements.

This page provides a historical record of runtime upgrades by block for each of the Moonbeam-based networks.

## Runtime Upgrades by Block {: #runtime-upgrades-by-block }

The following table contains a list of the runtime upgrades and the block at which the upgrade occurred for each network. Runtime upgrades occur first on Moonbase Alpha before being released on Moonriver and then on Moonbeam. You can read the release notes for each runtime on the [Moonbeam releases GitHub page](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank}.

Not all runtime upgrades are released on each network, as sometimes after releasing the initial runtime upgrade, the need for a subsequent upgrade arises. If a runtime upgrade version has been skipped or hasn't been released yet (only applicable to the latest runtime upgrade), you'll see a `-` in that row.

# Supported Ethereum RPC Methods

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Moonbeam team has collaborated closely with [Parity](https://www.parity.io){target=\_blank} on developing [Frontier](/learn/platform/technology/#frontier){target=\_blank}, an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate-based chains. This layer enables developers to run unmodified Ethereum dApps on Moonbeam seamlessly.

Nevertheless, not all Ethereum JSON-RPC methods are supported; some of those supported return default values (those related to Ethereum's PoW consensus mechanism in particular). This guide provides a comprehensive list of supported Ethereum JSON-RPC methods on Moonbeam. Developers can quickly reference this list to understand the available functionality for interfacing with Moonbeam's Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

## Default Block Parameters {: #default-block-parameters }

Moonbeam supports several default block parameters that allow you to query a subset of JSON-RPC methods at significant block heights. Moonbeam supports the following default block parameters: 

- `finalized` - Refers to the most recent block that Polkadot validators have finalized
- `safe` - Synonymous with `finalized` in Moonbeam. In Ethereum, `safe` refers to the most recent block that is considered safe by the network, meaning it is unlikely to be reverted but has not yet been finalized. With Moonbeam's fast and deterministic finality, `finalized` and `safe` refer to the same blocks. 
- `earliest` - Refers to the genesis block of the blockchain
- `pending` - Represents the latest state, including pending transactions that have not yet been mined into a block. This is a live view of the mempool
- `latest` - Refers to the latest confirmed block in the blockchain, which may not be finalized

## Unsupported Ethereum JSON-RPC Methods {: #unsupported-rpc-methods }

Moonbeam does not support the following Ethereum API JSON-RPC methods:

 - **[eth_getProof](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/ethereum/ethereum-api-endpoints/eth-get-proof){target=\_blank}** - returns the account and storage values of the specified account including the Merkle-proof
 - **[eth_blobBaseFee](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/ethereum/eth_blobBaseFee){target=\_blank}** - returns the expected base fee for blobs in the next block
 - **[eth_createAccessList](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/ethereum/ethereum-api-endpoints/eth-create-access-list){target=\_blank}** - creates an EIP-2930 type `accessList` based on a given transaction object
 - **[eth_sign](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_sign){target=\_blank}** - allows the user to sign an arbitrary hash to be sent at a later time. Presents a [security risk](https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/what-is-eth_sign-and-why-is-it-a-risk/){target=\_blank} as the arbitrary hash can be fraudulently applied to other transactions
 - **[eth_signTransaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_signtransaction){target=\_blank}** - allows the user to sign a transaction to be sent at a later time. It is rarely used due to associated security risks

# Moonbeam Custom API

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam nodes include support for custom JSON-RPC endpoints: 

- `moon_isBlockFinalized` 
- `moon_isTxFinalized`
- `moon_getEthSyncBlockRange`

These endpoints provide valuable functionality for checking the finality of on-chain events.

To begin exploring Moonbeam's custom JSON-RPC endpoints, you can try out the provided curl examples below. These examples demonstrate how to query the public RPC endpoint of Moonbase Alpha. However, you can easily modify them to use with your own Moonbeam or Moonriver endpoint by changing the URL and API key. If you haven't already, you can obtain your endpoint and API key from one of our supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.

# Overview of the Precompiled Contracts on Moonbeam

## Overview {: #introduction }

On Moonbeam, a precompiled contract is native Substrate code that has an Ethereum-style address and can be called using the Ethereum API, like any other smart contract. The precompiles allow you to call the Substrate runtime directly which is not normally accessible from the Ethereum side of Moonbeam.

The Substrate code responsible for implementing precompiles can be found in the [EVM pallet](/learn/platform/technology/#evm-pallet){target=\_blank}. The EVM pallet includes the [standard precompiles found on Ethereum and some additional precompiles that are not specific to Ethereum](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm/precompile){target=\_blank}. It also provides the ability to create and execute custom precompiles through the generic [`Precompiles` trait](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/trait.Precompile.html){target=\_blank}. There are several custom Moonbeam-specific precompiles that have been created, all of which can be found in the [Moonbeam codebase](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/tree/master/precompiles){target=\_blank}. It is important to highlight that the precompiles from this list with the `CallableByContract` check are not callable inside the contract constructor.

The Ethereum precompiled contracts contain complex functionality that is computationally intensive, such as hashing and encryption. The custom precompiled contracts on Moonbeam provide access to Substrate-based functionality such as staking, governance, XCM-related functions, and more.

The Moonbeam-specific precompiles can be interacted with through familiar and easy-to-use Solidity interfaces using the Ethereum API, which are ultimately used to interact with the underlying Substrate interface. This flow is depicted in the following diagram:

![Precompiled Contracts Diagram](/images/builders/ethereum/precompiles/overview/overview-1.webp)

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam. Please refer to the [Security Considerations](/learn/core-concepts/security/){target=\_blank} page for more information.

## Precompiled Contract Addresses {: #precompiled-contract-addresses }

The precompiled contracts are categorized by address and based on the origin network. If you were to convert the precompiled addresses to decimal format, and break them into categories by numeric value, the categories are as follows:

- **0-1023** - [Ethereum MainNet precompiles](#ethereum-mainnet-precompiles)
- **1024-2047** - precompiles that are [not in Ethereum and not Moonbeam specific](#non-moonbeam-specific-nor-ethereum-precomiles)
- **2048-4095** - [Moonbeam specific precompiles](#moonbeam-specific-precompiles)

# Network Endpoints

## Public Endpoints {: #public-endpoints }

Moonbeam-based networks have two endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

The endpoints in this section are for development purposes only and are not meant to be used in production applications.

If you are looking for an API provider suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](#endpoint-providers) section of this guide.

## Lazy Loading with RPC Endpoint Providers {: #lazy-loading-with-RPC-Endpoint-Providers }

Lazy loading lets a Moonbeam node operate while downloading network state in the background, eliminating the need to wait for full synchronization before use. To spin up a Moonbeam node with lazy loading, you'll need to either [download the Moonbeam release binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#the-release-binary){target=_blank} or [compile the binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/compile-binary/#compile-the-binary){target=_blank}. You can activate lazy loading with the following flag:

`--lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT-RPC-URL'`

Lazy loading is highly resource-intensive, requiring many RPC requests to function. To avoid being throttled, it's recommended that you use a [dedicated endpoint](#endpoint-providers) (i.e., an endpoint with an API key) rather than a public endpoint. You will likely be rate-limited if you use lazy loading with a public endpoint. Upon spooling up a node with this feature, you'll see output like the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty>[Lazy loading 🌗]
    <br>You are now running the Moonbeam client in lazy loading mode, where data is retrieved
    <br>from a live RPC node on demand.
    <br>Using remote state from: https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com
    <br>Forking from block: 8482853
    <br>To ensure the client works properly, please note the following:
    <br>    1. *Avoid Throttling*: Ensure that the backing RPC node is not limiting the number of
    <br>    requests, as this can prevent the lazy loading client from functioning correctly;
    <br>    2. *Be Patient*: As the client may take approximately 20 times longer than normal to
    <br>    retrieve and process the necessary data for the requested operation.
    <br>The service will start in 10 seconds...</span>
</div>

### Overriding State with Lazy Loading

By default, you won't see detailed logging in the terminal. To override this setting and show lazy loading logs, you can add the following flag to your command to start the Moonbeam node: `-l debug`. You can further customize your use of the lazy loading functionality with the following optional parameters:

- **`--lazy-loading-block`** - specifies a block hash from which to start loading data. If not provided, the latest block will be used
- **`--lazy-loading-delay-between-requests`** - the delay (in milliseconds) between RPC requests when using lazy loading. This parameter controls the amount of time to wait between consecutive RPC requests. This can help manage request rate and avoid overwhelming the server. Default value is `100` milliseconds
- **`--lazy-loading-max-retries-per-request`** - the maximum number of retries for an RPC request when using lazy loading. Default value is `10` retries
- **`--lazy-loading-runtime-override`** - path to a WASM file to override the runtime when forking. If not provided, it will fetch the runtime from the block being forked
- **`--lazy-loading-state-overrides`** - path to a JSON file containing state overrides to be applied when forking

#### Simple Storage Item Override

The state overrides file should define the respective pallet, storage item, and value that you seek to override as follows:

```json
[
 {
     "pallet": "System",
     "storage": "SelectedCandidates",
     "value": "0x04f24ff3a9cf04c71dbc94d0b566f7a27b94566cac"
 }
]
```

#### Override an Account's Free Balance

To override the balance of a particular account, you can override the account storage item of the system pallet for the respective account as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "pallet": "System",
    "storage": "Account",
    "key": "TARGET_ADDRESS",
    "value": "0x460c000002000000010000000600000069e10de76676d0800000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080"
  }
]
```

??? note "Details about overriding account balances"

    Overriding an account balance, as shown above, can be a complex process. However, this guide will break it down into steps that are easy to follow. Before making any changes, you should obtain the existing value corresponding to the key (i.e., the account in this case). You can go to [**Chain State** on Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network#/chainstate){target=_blank} and query the System pallet by providing the account you'd like to query. Upon submitting the query, you'll get back a readable account structure like so:

    ```text
    {
      nonce: 3,142
      consumers: 2
      providers: 1
      sufficients: 6
      data: {
        free: 1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676
        reserved: 348,052,500,000,000,000,000
        frozen: 20,413,910,106,633,175,872
        flags: 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
      }
    }
    ```

    While this is useful as a reference, the information you're looking for is the encoded storage key, which is accessible even without submitting the chain state query. In this instance, the encoded storage key corresponding to the system pallet and the selected account `0x3B939FeaD1557C741Ff06492FD0127bd287A421e` is:

    ```text
    0x26aa394eea5630e07c48ae0c9558cef7b99d880ec681799c0cf30e8886371da9b882fedb4f75b055c709ec5b66b5d9933b939fead1557c741ff06492fd0127bd287a421e
    ```

    Note that this encoded storage key will change alongside any input changes, such as a different account being queried. Then, head over the **Raw Storage** tab on [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate/raw){target=_blank}. Input the above storage key and submit the query. The response is the SCALE encoded account struct, a part of which contains the free balance information to be modified as part of this example: 

    ```text
    0x460c0000020000000100000006000000a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080
    ```

    There is quite a bit of data encoded in the value field because it is a complex struct comprised of multiple values. The struct is comprised of:

    ```text
    struct AccountInfo {
        nonce: u32,             // Transaction count
        consumers: u32,         // Number of consumers 
        providers: u32,         // Number of providers
        sufficients: u32,       // Number of sufficients
        data: AccountData {     // The balance info
            free: u128,         // Free balance
            reserved: u128,     // Reserved balance
            frozen: u128,       // Frozen balance
            flags: u128         // Account flags
        }
    }
    ```

    You can associate each part of the SCALE encoded struct with the corresponding piece of Alice's account information that it represents:

    ```text
    0x460c0000        // nonce (u32): 3,142 
    02000000          // consumers (u32): 2
    01000000          // providers (u32): 1  
    06000000          // sufficients (u32): 6

    a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045000000000000000  
    // free (u128): 1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676

    40a556b0e032de1200000000000000000  
    // reserved (u128): 348,052,500,000,000,000,000  

    4083a09e15c74c1b01000000000000000  
    // frozen (u128): 20,413,910,106,633,175,872

    00000000000000000000000000000080   
    // flags (u128): 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
    ```

    Remember that the values are little endian encoded. To convert the hexadecimal little endian encoded values to decimal, you can use [Substrate Utilities converter](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/){target=_blank}, using the **Balance to Hex (Little Endian)** converter.

    In this example, the existing free balance of `1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676` Wei or approximately `1278.60` DEV is `a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045`. The following example will change the value to `500,000` DEV, which is `500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000` Wei or `0x000080d07666e70de169` encoded as a hexadecimal little endian value. When properly padded to fit into the SCALE encoded storage value, it becomes `69e10de76676d08000000000000000000`, such that the table now looks like:

    ```text
    0x460c0000        // nonce (u32): 3,142 
    02000000          // consumers (u32): 2
    01000000          // providers (u32): 1  
    06000000          // sufficients (u32): 6

    69e10de76676d08000000000000000000
    // free (u128): 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

    40a556b0e032de1200000000000000000  
    // reserved (u128): 348,052,500,000,000,000,000  

    4083a09e15c74c1b01000000000000000  
    // frozen (u128): 20,413,910,106,633,175,872

    00000000000000000000000000000080   
    // flags (u128): 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
    ```

    Therefore, the SCALE encoded override value is as follows:

    ```text
    0x460c000002000000010000000600000069e10de76676d0800000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080
    ```

    You can now specify the SCALE encoded override value in your `state-overrides.json` file as follows:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "pallet": "System",

    To run lazy loading with the balance state override, you can use the following command: 

    ```bash
    --lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT_RPC_URL' --lazy-loading-state-overrides ./state-overrides.json
    ```

#### Override an ERC-20 Token Balance

To override an ERC-20 token balance, identify the storage slot in the EVM’s AccountStorages where the `balanceOf` data for the given token contract and account is stored. This storage slot is determined by the token contract’s H160 address and the corresponding H256 storage key. Once you have this slot, specify the new balance value in the `state-overrides.json` file to implement the override.

In the example below, we override the token balance of the [Wormhole USDC Contract (`0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c`)](https://moonscan.io/address/0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c){target=_blank} for the account `0x3b939fead1557c741ff06492fd0127bd287a421e` to $5,000 USDC. Since Wormhole USDC uses 6 decimal places, $5,000 corresponds to `5000000000` in integer form, which is `0x12a05f200` in hexadecimal.

```json
[
    {
        "pallet": "EVM",
        "storage": "AccountStorages",
        "key": [
            "0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c",
            "0x8c9902c0f94ae586c91ba539eb52087d3dd1578da91158308d79ff24a8d4f342"
        ],
        "value": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012a05f200"
    }
]
```

You can calculate the exact storage slot to override for your own account with the following script:

```js
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

function getBalanceSlot(accountAddress) {
  // Convert address to bytes32 and normalize
  const addr = ethers.zeroPadValue(accountAddress, 32);

  // CAUTION! The storage slot used here is 5, which
  // is specific to Wormhole contracts
  // The storage slot index for other tokens may vary
  const packedData = ethers.concat([
    addr,
    ethers.zeroPadValue(ethers.toBeHex(5), 32),
  ]);

  // Calculate keccak256
  return ethers.keccak256(packedData);
}

// Example usage
const address = 'INSERT_ADDRESS';
console.log(getBalanceSlot(address));
```

You can apply the same process for other ERC-20 token contracts. The following sections demonstrate overrides for the `0x3B939FeaD1557C741Ff06492FD0127bd287A421e` account with various ERC-20 tokens. Remember to update the H160 token contract address whenever you switch to a different token. Also, you will need to recalculate the H256 storage slot for each distinct account whose balance you want to override.

??? code "Example: Override WELL Token Balance"

    Because the [WELL token](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/token/0x511ab53f793683763e5a8829738301368a2411e3){target=_blank} does not use a proxy implementation contract, the storage slot calculation differs. Instead of slot `5`, the balance mapping resides at slot `1`. You can determine the exact storage slot to override the WELL token balance for your own account using the following script:

    ```js
    import { ethers } from 'ethers';

    function getBalanceSlot(accountAddress) {
      // Convert address to bytes32 and normalize
      const addr = ethers.zeroPadValue(accountAddress, 32);

      // Caution! The storage slot index used here is 1
      // The storage slot index for other tokens may vary
      const packedData = ethers.concat([
        addr,
        ethers.zeroPadValue(ethers.toBeHex(1), 32),
      ]);

      // Calculate keccak256
      return ethers.keccak256(packedData);
    }

    // Example usage
    const address = 'INSERT_ADDRESS';
    console.log(getBalanceSlot(address));
    ```

    Thus, the storage override would be:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "pallet": "EVM",
            "storage": "AccountStorages",
            "key": [
                "0x511aB53F793683763E5a8829738301368a2411E3",
                "0x728d3daf4878939a6bb58cbc263f39655bb57ea15db7daa0b306f3bf2c3f1227"
            ],
            "value": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012a05f200"
        }
    ]
    ```

## Tracing RPC Endpoint Providers {: #tracing-providers }

Tracing RPC endpoints allow you to access non-standard RPC methods, such as those that belong to Geth's `debug` and `txpool` APIs and OpenEthereum's `trace` module. To see a list of the supported non-standard RPC methods on Moonbeam for debugging and tracing, please refer to the [Debug API & Trace Module](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/){target=_blank} guide.

The following providers provide tracing RPC endpoints:

- [OnFinality](#onfinality-tracing)

### OnFinality {: #onfinality-tracing }

[OnFinality](https://onfinality.io){target=_blank}'s Trace API can be used to quickly get started tracing and debugging transactions on Moonbeam and Moonriver. It is only available to users on their [Growth and Ultimate plans](https://onfinality.io/pricing){target=_blank}.

To use the Trace API, you simply call the trace method of your choice from your [private RPC endpoint](#onfinality). For a list of the supported networks and trace methods, please check out [OnFinality's Trace API documentation](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/trace-api#TraceAPI-SupportedNetworks){target=_blank}.

Please note that if you are tracing historic blocks, it is recommended to use your own dedicated trace node to backfill any data, and then once you're caught up, you can switch to using the Trace API. You can check out the [How to Deploy a Trace Node for Moonbeam on OnFinality](https://onfinality.medium.com/how-to-deploy-a-trace-node-for-moonbeam-on-onfinality-85683181d290){target=-_blank} post for more information on how to spin up your own dedicated trace node.
