# Collator Account Management

## Introduction {: #introduction }

When running a collator node on Moonbeam-based networks, there are some account management activities that you will need to be aware of. First and foremost you will need to create [session keys](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-cryptography/#session-keys){target=\_blank} for your primary and backup servers which will be used to determine block production and sign blocks.

In addition, there are some optional account management activities that you can consider such as setting an on-chain identity or setting up proxy accounts.

This guide will cover how to manage your collator account including generating and rotating your session keys, registering and updating your session keys, setting an identity, and creating proxy accounts.

## Process to Add and Update Session Keys {: #process }

The process for adding your session keys for the first time is the same as it would be for rotating your session keys. The process to create/rotate session keys is as follows:

1. [Generate session keys](#session-keys) using the `author_rotateKeys` RPC method. The response to calling this method will be a 128 hexadecimal character string containing a Nimbus ID and the public key of a VRF session key
2. [Join the candidate pool](/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/#become-a-candidate){target=\_blank} if you haven't already
3. [Map the session keys](#mapping-extrinsic) to your candidate account using the [Author Mapping Pallet](#author-mapping-interface)'s `setKeys(keys)` extrinsic, which accepts the entire 128 hexadecimal character string as the input. When you call `setKeys` for the first time, you'll be required to submit a [mapping bond](#mapping-bonds). If you're rotating your keys and you've previously submitted a mapping bond, no new bond is required

Each step of the process is outlined in the following sections.

## Generate Session Keys {: #session-keys }

To match the Substrate standard, Moonbeam collator's session keys are [SR25519](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-cryptography/#what-is-sr25519-and-where-did-it-come-from){target=\_blank}. This guide will show you how you can create/rotate your session keys associated with your collator node.

First, make sure you're [running a collator node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/){target=\_blank}. Once you have your collator node running, your terminal should print similar logs:

</div>

Next, session keys can be created/rotated by sending an RPC call to the HTTP endpoint with the `author_rotateKeys` method. When you call `author_rotateKeys`, the result is the size of two keys. The response will contain a concatenated Nimbus ID and VRF key. The Nimbus ID will be used to sign blocks and the [VRF](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/web3-and-polkadot/#vrf){target=\_blank} key is required for block production. The concatenated keys will be used to create an association to your H160 account for block rewards to be paid out.

For reference, if your collator's HTTP endpoint is at port `9944`, the JSON-RPC call might look like this:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9944 -H \
"Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"author_rotateKeys",
    "params": []
  }'
```

The collator node should respond with the concatenated public keys of your new session keys. The first 64 hexadecimal characters after the `0x` prefix represent your Nimbus ID and the last 64 hexadecimal characters are the public key of your VRF session key. You'll use the concatenated public keys when mapping your Nimbus ID and setting the session keys in the next section.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>curl http://127.0.0.1:9933-H\ "Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \</span>
    <span data-ty>'{</span>
    <span data-ty>"jsonrpc": "2.0",</span>
    <span data-ty>"id" :1,</span>
    <span data-ty>"method": "author_rotatekeys",</span>
    <span data-ty>"params": []</span>
    <span data-ty>}'</span>
    <span data-ty>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result":"0x72c7ca7ef0794103caeb520806576b52cb085f7577cc12cd36c2d64dbf73757a789407ec0f401a8792ac57c4fb7dabd4da6cc74d9ac9b8dd8c4faf770255403f", "id" :1}</span>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

Make sure you write down the concatenated public keys. Each of your servers, your primary and backup, should have their own unique keys. Since the keys never leave your servers, you can consider them a unique ID for that server.

Next, you'll need to register your session keys and map them to an H160 Ethereum-styled address to which the block rewards are paid.

## Manage Session Keys {: #manage-session-keys }

Once you've created or rotated your session keys, you'll be able to manage your session keys using the extrinsics in the Author Mapping Pallet. You can map your session keys, verify the on-chain mappings, and remove session keys.

### Author Mapping Pallet Interface {: #author-mapping-interface }

The `authorMapping` module has the following extrinsics:

 - **setKeys**(keys) — accepts the result of calling `author_rotateKeys`, which is the concatenated public keys of your Nimbus and VRF keys, and sets the session keys at once. Useful after a key rotation or migration. Calling `setKeys` requires a [bond](#mapping-bonds). Replaces the deprecated `addAssociation` and `updateAssociation` extrinsics
- **removeKeys**() - removes the session keys. This is only required if you intend to stop collating and leave the candidate pool. Replaces the deprecated `clearAssociation` extrinsic

The module also adds the following RPC calls (chain state):

- **mappingWithDeposit**(NimbusPrimitivesNimbusCryptoPublic | string | Uint8Array) — displays all mappings stored on-chain, or only that related to the Nimbus ID if provided
- **nimbusLookup**(AccountId20) - displays a reverse mapping of account IDs to Nimbus IDs for all collators or for a given collator address

### Map Session Keys {: #mapping-extrinsic }

With your newly generated session keys in hand, the next step is to map your session keys to your H160 account (an Ethereum-style address). Make sure you hold the private keys to this account, as this is where the block rewards are paid out to.

To map your session keys to your account, you need to be inside the [candidate pool](/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/#become-a-candidate){target=\_blank}. Once you are a candidate, you need to send a mapping extrinsic, which requires a mapping bond.

#### Mapping Bonds {: #mapping-bonds }

The mapping bond is per session keys registered. The bond for mapping your session keys to your account is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.staking.collator_map_bond }} GLMR
    ```
  
=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.staking.collator_map_bond }} MOVR
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.staking.collator_map_bond }} DEV
    ```

#### Use Polkadot.js Apps to Map Session Keys {: #use-polkadotjs-apps }

In this section, you'll learn how to map session keys from Polkadot.js Apps. To learn how to create the mapping through the author mapping precompiled contract, you can refer to the page on [Interacting with the Author Mapping Precompile](/node-operators/networks/collators/author-mapping/){target=\_blank}.

To create the mapping from [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/assets){target=\_blank} (make sure you're connected to the correct network), click on **Developer** at the top of the page, choose the **Extrinsics** option from the dropdown, and take the following steps:

 1. Choose the account that you want to map your author ID to be associated with, from which you'll sign this transaction
 2. Select the **authorMapping** extrinsic
 3. Set the method to **setKeys()**
 4. Enter the **keys**. It is the response obtained via the RPC call `author_rotateKeys` in the previous section, which is the concatenated public keys of your Nimbus ID and VRF key
 5. Click on **Submit Transaction**

![Author ID Mapping to Account Extrinsic](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/account-1.webp)

!!! note
    If you receive the following error, you may need to try rotating and mapping your keys again: `VRF PreDigest was not included in the digests (check rand key is in keystore)`.

If the transaction is successful, you will see a confirmation notification on your screen. If not, make sure you've [joined the candidate pool](/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/#become-a-candidate){target=\_blank}.

### Check Mappings {: #checking-the-mappings }

You can check the current on-chain mappings by verifying the chain state. You can do this one of two ways: via the `mappingWithDeposit` method or the `nimbusLookup` method. Both methods can be used to query the on-chain data for all of the collators or for a specific collator.

You can check the current on-chain mappings for a specific collator or you can also check all of the mappings stored on-chain.

#### Using the Mapping with Deposit Method {: #using-mapping-with-deposit }

To use the `mappingWithDeposit` method to check the mapping for a specific collator, you'll need to get the Nimbus ID. To do so, you can take the first 64 hexadecimal characters of the concatenated public keys to get the Nimbus ID. To verify that the Nimbus ID is correct, you can run the following command with the first 64 characters passed into the `params` array:

```bash
curl {{ networks.development.rpc_url }} -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d   '{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":1,
  "method":"author_hasKey",
  "params": ["72c7ca7ef07941a3caeb520806576b52cb085f7577cc12cd36c2d64dbf73757a", "nmbs"]
}'
```

If it's correct the response should return `"result": true`.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>curl http://127.0.0.1:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;char set=utf-8" -d '{</span>
    <span data-ty>"jsonrpc":"2.0"</span>
    <span data-ty>"id" :1,</span>
    <span data-ty>"method": "author_hasKey",</span>
    <span data-ty>"params": ["72c7ca7ef07941a3caeb520806576b52cb085f7577c12c36c2d64dbf73757a", "nmbs"]</span>
    <span data-ty>}'</span>
    <span data-ty>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "result" :true, "id" :1}</span>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

From [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/assets){target=\_blank}, click on **Developer** at the top of the page, then choose **Chain State** from the dropdown, and take the following steps:

 1. Choose **authorMapping** as the state to query
 2. Select the **mappingWithDeposit** method
 3. Provide a Nimbus ID to query. Optionally, you can disable the slider to retrieve all mappings 
 4. Click on the **+** button to send the RPC call

![Nimbus ID Mapping Chain State](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/account-2.webp)

You should be able to see the H160 account associated with the Nimbus ID provided and the deposit paid. If no Nimbus ID was included, this would return all the mappings stored on-chain.

#### Using the Nimbus Lookup Method {: #using-nimbus-lookup }

To use the `nimbusLookup` method to check the mapping for a specific collator, you'll need the collator's address. If you do not pass an argument to the method, you can retrieve all of the on-chain mappings.

From [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/assets){target=\_blank}, click on **Developer** at the top of the page, then choose **Chain State** from the dropdown, and take the following steps:

 1. Choose **authorMapping** as the state to query
 2. Select the **nimbusLookup** method
 3. Provide a collator's address to query. Optionally, you can disable the slider to retrieve all mappings
 4. Click on the **+** button to send the RPC call

![Nimbus ID Mapping Chain State](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/account-3.webp)

You should be able to see the nimbus ID associated with the H160 account provided. If no account was provided, this would return all the mappings stored on-chain.

### Remove Session Keys {: #removing-session-keys }

Before removing your session keys, you'll want to make sure that you've stopped collating and left the candidate pool. To stop collating, you'll need to schedule a request to leave the candidate pool, wait a delay period, and then execute the request. For step-by-step instructions, please refer to the [Stop Collating](/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/#stop-collating){target=\_blank} section of the Moonbeam Collator Activities page.

Once you have left the candidate pool, you can remove your session keys. After which, the mapping bond you deposited will be returned to your account.

From [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/assets){target=\_blank}, click on **Developer** at the top of the page, then choose **Extrinsics** from the dropdown, and take the following steps:

1. Select your account
2. Choose the **authorMapping** pallet and the **removeKeys** extrinsic
3. Click **Submit Transaction**

![Remove session keys on Polkadot.js Apps](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/account-4.webp)

Once the transaction goes through, the mapping bond will be returned to you. To make sure that the keys were removed, you can follow the steps in the [Check Mappings](#checking-the-mappings) section.

## Setting an Identity {: #setting-an-identity }

Setting an on-chain identity enables your collator node to be easily identifiable. As opposed to showing your account address, your chosen display name will be displayed instead.

There are a couple of ways you can set your identity, to learn how to set an identity for your collator node please check out the [Managing your Account Identity](/tokens/manage/identity/){target=\_blank} page of our documentation.

## Proxy Accounts {: #proxy-accounts }

Proxy accounts are accounts that can be enabled to perform a limited number of actions on your behalf. Proxies allow users to keep a primary account securely in cold storage while using the proxy to actively participate in the network on behalf of the primary account. You can remove authorization of the proxy account at any time. As an additional layer of security, you can setup your proxy with a delay period. This delay period would provide you time to review the transaction, and cancel if needed, before it automatically gets executed.

To learn how to setup a proxy account, please refer to the [Setting up a Proxy Account](/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/){target=\_blank} page of our documentation.

# Collator Activities

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Becoming a collator on Moonbeam-based networks requires you to meet [bonding requirements](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#bonding-requirements){target=\_blank} and join the candidate pool. Once you're in the candidate pool, you can adjust your self-bond amount or decide to leave the pool at any time.

If you wish to reduce your self-bond amount or leave the candidate pool, it requires you to first schedule a request to leave and then execute upon the request after a [delay period](#collator-timings) has passed.

This guide will take you through important timings to be aware of when leaving or reducing your self-bond amount, how to join and leave the candidate pool, and how to adjust your self-bond.

## Collator Timings {: #collator-timings }

Before getting started, it's important to note some of the timing of different actions related to collator activities:

!!! note
    The values presented in the previous table are subject to change in future releases.

!!! note
    As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.

## Become a Candidate {: #become-a-candidate }

### Get the Size of the Candidate Pool {: #get-the-size-of-the-candidate-pool }

First, you need to get the `candidatePool` size (this can change through governance), as you'll need to submit this parameter in a later transaction. To do so, you'll have to run the following JavaScript code snippet from within [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/js){target=\_blank}:

```js
// Simple script to get candidate pool size
const candidatePool = await api.query.parachainStaking.candidatePool();
console.log(`Candidate pool size is: ${candidatePool.length}`);
```

Head to the **Developer** tab, select **JavaScript** from the dropdown, and take the following steps:

 1. Copy the code from the previous snippet and paste it inside the code editor box. (Optional) Click the save icon and set a name for the code snippet, for example, "Get candidatePool size". This will save the code snippet locally
 2. To execute the code, click on the run button
 3. Copy the result, as you'll need it when joining the candidate pool

![Get Number of Candidates](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-1.webp)

### Join the Candidate Pool {: #join-the-candidate-pool }

Once your node is running and in sync with the network, you become a candidate and join the candidate pool. Depending on which network you are connected to, head to [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/accounts){target=\_blank}, click on the **Developer** tab, select **Extrinsics** from the dropdown, and take the following steps:

 1. Select the account you want to become a collator. Confirm your account is funded with at least the [minimum stake required](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#minimum-collator-bond){target=\_blank} plus some extra for transaction fees
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Open the drop-down menu, which lists all the possible extrinsics related to staking, and select the **joinCandidates** function
 4. Set the bond to at least the [minimum amount](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#minimum-collator-bond){target=\_blank} to be considered a candidate. You'll need to enter this amount in `Wei`. As an example, the minimum bond of {{ networks.moonbase.staking.min_can_stk }} DEV on Moonbase Alpha would be `{{ networks.moonbase.staking.min_can_stk_wei }}` in Wei ({{ networks.moonbase.staking.min_can_stk }} + 18 extra zeros). Only the candidate bond counts for this check. Additional delegations do not count
 5. Set the candidate count as the candidate pool size. To learn how to retrieve this value, check the [Get the Size of the Candidate Pool](#get-the-size-of-the-candidate-pool) section
 6. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Join candidate pool via Polkadot.js](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-2.webp)

!!! note
    Function names and the minimum bond requirement are subject to change in future releases.

As mentioned before, only the top candidates by delegated stake will be in the active set of collators. The exact number of candidates in the top for each network and the minimum bond amount can be found in the [Minimum Collator Bond](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#minimum-collator-bond){target=\_blank} section.

## Stop Collating {: #stop-collating }

To stop collating and leave the candidate pool, you must first schedule a request to leave the pool. Scheduling a request automatically removes you from the active set, so you will no longer be eligible to produce blocks or earn rewards. You must wait for the duration of the [exit delay](#collator-timings) before you can execute the request to leave. After the request has been executed, you will be removed from the candidate pool.

Similar to [Polkadot's `chill()`](https://docs.polkadot.com/infrastructure/running-a-validator/operational-tasks/pause-validating/){target=\_blank} functionality, you can [temporarily leave the candidate pool](#temporarily-leave-the-candidate-pool) without unbonding your tokens.

### Schedule Request to Leave Candidates {: #schedule-request-to-leave-candidates }

To get started and schedule a request, navigate to the **Developer** tab, click on **Extrinsics**, and take the following steps:

 1. Select your candidate account
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Select the **scheduleLeaveCandidates** extrinsic
 4. Enter the `candidateCount` which you should have retrieved in the [Get the Size of the Candidate Pool](#get-the-size-of-the-candidate-pool) section
 5. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Schedule leave candidates request](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-3.webp)

### Execute Request to Leave Candidates {: #execute-request-to-leave-candidates }

After the waiting period has passed, you'll be able to execute the request. To execute the request to leave the candidate pool, you'll first need to obtain the number of delegations the candidate has. To do so, you can query the candidate information, which will include the delegation count. To get started, click on the **Developer** tab, select **Chain state**, and take the following steps:

 1. From the **selected state query** dropdown, choose **parachainStaking**
 2. Select the **candidateInfo** extrinsic
 3. Choose the candidate account to get the information for
 4. Click the **+** button to submit the extrinsic
 5. Copy the **`delegationCount`** to be used for executing the leave candidates request

![Get delegation count](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-4.webp)

Now that you have the delegation count, you can execute the request. Switch back to the **Extrinsics** tab and follow these steps:

 1. Select your candidate account
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Select the **executeLeaveCandidates** extrinsic
 4. Select the target candidate account (anyone can execute the request after the exit delay has passed after submitting the `scheduleLeaveCandidates` extrinsic)
 5. Enter the candidate's delegation count
 6. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Execute leave candidates request](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-5.webp)

### Cancel Request to Leave Candidates {: #cancel-request-to-leave-candidates }

If you scheduled a request to leave the candidate pool but changed your mind, as long as the request has not been executed, you can cancel the request and remain in the candidate pool. To cancel the request, make sure you've clicked on  **Extrinsics** from the **Developer** tab, and then follow these steps:

 1. Select your candidate account
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Select the **cancelLeaveCandidates** extrinsic
 4. Provide the `candidateCount` which you should have retrieved in the [Get the Size of the Candidate Pool](#get-the-size-of-the-candidate-pool) section
 5. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Cancel leave candidates request](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-6.webp)

### Temporarily Leave the Candidate Pool {: #temporarily-leave-the-candidate-pool }

If you want to temporarily leave the candidate pool, you can easily do so using the `goOffline` method. This can be useful, for example, if you need to temporarily leave to perform maintenance operations. Once you're done, you can then rejoin the pool using the `goOnline` method.

To temporarily leave, you can take the following steps:

 1. Navigate to the **Developer** tab
 2. Click on **Extrinsics**
 3. Select your candidate account
 4. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 5. Select the **goOffline** extrinsic
 6. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Temporarily leave candidates pool](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-7.webp)

Then, whenever you wish to rejoin, you can use the `goOnline` method by following the same steps outlined above, and then in step 5, choose the `goOnline` extrinsic. Please note that you can only call `goOnline` if you have previously called `goOffline`.

## Change Self-Bond Amount {: #change-self-bond-amount }

As a candidate, changing your self-bond amount varies slightly depending on whether you're bonding more or less. If you're bonding more, it is a straightforward process where you can increase your stake via the `candidateBondMore()` extrinsic. You do not have to wait for any delays, and you do not need to schedule a request and then execute it; instead, your request will be executed instantly and automatically.

If you wish to bond less, you have to schedule a request, wait for an [exit delay](#collator-timings), and then you will be able to execute the request and get a specified amount of tokens back into your free balance. In other words, scheduling the request doesn't decrease the bond instantly or automatically; it will only decrease once the request has been executed.

### Bond More {: #bond-more }

As a candidate, there are two options for increasing one's stake. The first and recommended option is to send the funds to be staked to another owned address and [delegate to your collator](/tokens/staking/stake/#how-to-nominate-a-collator). Alternatively, collators that already have at least the [minimum self-bond amount](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#minimum-collator-bond){target=\_blank} staked can increase their bond from [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonriver.moonbeam.network#/accounts){target=\_blank}. Navigate to the **Developer** tab, click on **Extrinsics**, and follow these steps:

 1. Select your collator account (and verify it contains the additional funds to be bonded)
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Open the drop-down menu, which lists all the possible extrinsics related to staking, and select the **candidateBondMore** function
 4. Specify the additional amount to be bonded in the **more: BalanceOf** field
 5. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Collator Bond More](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-8.webp)

### Bond Less {: #bond-less}

As a collator or collator candidate, you may decrease your amount bonded as long as you have more than the [minimum self-bond amount](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#minimum-collator-bond){target=\_blank} after the decrease.

In order to bond less, you have to first schedule a request, wait for the duration of the [exit delay](#collator-timings), and then execute the request. You can [cancel a request](#cancel-bond-less-request) at any time, as long as the request hasn't been executed yet.

#### Schedule Bond Less Request {: #schedule-bond-less }

To schedule a request to bond less, make sure you've clicked on the **Developer** tab and clicked on **Extrinsics**, then you can follow these steps:

 1. Select your candidate account
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Open the drop-down menu and select the **scheduleCandidateBondLess** function
 4. Specify the amount to decrease the bond by in the  **less: BalanceOf** field
 5. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Schedule Candidate Bond Less](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-9.webp)

Once the transaction is confirmed, you must wait the duration of the exit delay and then you will be able to execute and decrease the bond amount. If you try to execute the request before the exit delay, your extrinsic will fail, and you'll see an error in Polkadot.js for `parachainStaking.PendingDelegationRequest`.

#### Execute Bond Less Request {: #execute-bond-less-request }

After the exit delay has passed from scheduling a request to decrease your bond, you can execute the request to actually decrease the bond amount. Head to the **Developer** tab, select **Extrinsics**, and follow these steps:

 1. Select an account to execute the request with
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Select the **executeCandidateBondLess** extrinsic
 4. Select the target candidate account (anyone can execute the request after the exit delay has passed since the `scheduleCandidateBondLess` was submitted)
 5. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Execute Candidate Bond Less](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-10.webp)

Once the transaction has been confirmed, you can check your free and reserved balances from the **Accounts** tab and notice that, now that the execution has gone through, your balances have been updated.

#### Cancel Bond Less Request {: #cancel-bond-less-request }

If you scheduled a request to bond more or less but changed your mind, as long as the request has not been executed, you can cancel the request at any time and keep your bond amount as is. To cancel the request, head to the **Developer** tab, select **Extrinsics**, and follow these steps:

 1. Select your candidate account (and verify it contains the additional funds to be bonded)
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Select the **cancelCandidateBondRequest** extrinsic
 4. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Cancel leave candidates request](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-11.webp)

## Mark a Collator as Inactive {: #mark-collator-as-inactive }

If there is an inactive collator that has not produced blocks for a consecutive number of rounds, you can mark a collator as inactive. The maximum number of rounds a collator can be offline before they can be marked as inactive is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    {{ networks.moonbeam.collator_timings.max_offline.rounds }} round ({{ networks.moonbeam.collator_timings.max_offline.hours }} hours)

=== "Moonriver"

    {{ networks.moonriver.collator_timings.max_offline.rounds }} rounds ({{ networks.moonriver.collator_timings.max_offline.hours }} hours)

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    {{ networks.moonbase.collator_timings.max_offline.rounds }} rounds ({{ networks.moonbase.collator_timings.max_offline.hours }} hours)

To mark a collator as inactive, you can use the `notifyInactiveCollator` extrinsic, which will notify the runtime when a collator is inactive and, by default, mark the collator as offline. To do so, you can head to  [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/accounts){target=\_blank}, make sure that you are connected to the correct network, then click on the **Developer** tab, select **Extrinsics** from the dropdown, and take the following steps:

 1. Select your account
 2. Select **parachainStaking** pallet under the **submit the following extrinsic** menu
 3. Select the **notifyInactiveCollator** extrinsic
 4. Specify the collator to mark as inactive
 5. Submit the transaction. Follow the wizard and sign the transaction using the password you set for the account

![Mark a collator as inactive](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/activities-12.webp)

The collator will temporarily be removed from the candidate pool, and they can rejoin at any time by calling the `goOnline` extrinsic.

# Interacting with the Author Mapping Precompile

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The author mapping precompiled contract on Moonbeam allows collator candidates to map session keys to a Moonbeam address where block rewards are paid out, through a familiar and easy-to-use Solidity interface. This enables candidates to complete author mapping with a Ledger or any other Ethereum wallet compatible with Moonbeam. However, it is recommended to generate your keys on an air-gapped machine. You can find out more information by referring to the [account requirements section of the Collator Requirements page](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#account-requirements){target=\_blank}.

To become a collator candidate, you must be [running a collator node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/){target=\_blank}. You'll also need to [join the candidate pool](/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/#become-a-candidate){target=\_blank} fully sync your node and submit the required [bonds](#bonds) before generating your session keys and mapping them to your account. There is an [additional bond](#bonds) that must be paid when mapping your session keys.

The precompile is located at the following address:

=== "Moonbeam"

     ```text
     {{networks.moonbeam.precompiles.author_mapping }}
     ```

=== "Moonriver"

     ```text
     {{networks.moonriver.precompiles.author_mapping }}
     ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

     ```text
     {{networks.moonbase.precompiles.author_mapping }}
     ```

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam. Please refer to the [Security Considerations](/learn/core-concepts/security/){target=\_blank} page for more information.

## The Author Mapping Solidity Interface {: #the-solidity-interface }

[`AuthorMappingInterface.sol`](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/author-mapping/AuthorMappingInterface.sol){target=\_blank} is a Solidity interface that allows developers to interact with the precompile's methods.

- **removeKeys**() - removes the author ID and session keys. Replaces the deprecated `clearAssociation` extrinsic
- **setKeys**(*bytes memory* keys) — accepts the result of calling `author_rotateKeys`, which is the concatenated public keys of your Nimbus and VRF keys, and sets the author ID and the session keys at once. Useful after a key rotation or migration. Calling `setKeys` requires a [bond](#bonds). Replaces the deprecated `addAssociation` and `updateAssociation` extrinsics
- **nimbusIdOf**(*address* who) - retrieves the Nimbus ID of the given address. If no Nimbus ID exists for the given address, it returns `0`
- **addressOf**(*bytes32* nimbusId) - retrieves the address associated to a given Nimbus ID. If the Nimbus ID is unknown, it returns `0`
- **keysOf**(*bytes32* nimbusId) - retrieves the keys associated to the given Nimbus ID. If the Nimbus ID is unknown, it returns empty bytes

## Required Bonds {: #bonds }

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need to join the candidate pool and map your session keys to your H160 Ethereum-style account. Two bonds are required to perform both of these actions.

The minimum bond to join the candidate pool is set as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.staking.min_can_stk }} GLMR
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.staking.min_can_stk }} MOVR
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.staking.min_can_stk }} DEV
    ```

There is a bond that is sent when mapping your session keys with your account. This bond is per session keys registered. The bond set is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.staking.collator_map_bond }} GLMR
    ```
  
=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.staking.collator_map_bond }} MOVR
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.staking.collator_map_bond }} DEV
    ```

## Interact with the Solidity Interface {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface }

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

The below example is demonstrated on Moonbase Alpha, however, similar steps can be taken for Moonbeam and Moonriver. You should:  

 - Have MetaMask installed and [connected to Moonbase Alpha](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}
 - Have an account with DEV tokens. You should have enough to cover the [candidate and mapping bonds](#bonds) plus gas fees to send the transaction and map your session keys to your account. To get enough DEV tokens to follow along with this guide, you can contact a moderator directly via the [Moonbeam Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank}
 - Make sure you're [running a collator node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/){target=\_blank} and it's fully synced
 - Make sure you've [joined the candidate pool](/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/#become-a-candidate){target=\_blank}

As previously mentioned, you can use a Ledger by connecting it to MetaMask. Please refer to the [Ledger](/tokens/connect/ledger/){target=\_blank} guide to import your Ledger to MetaMask. Note that Ledger is not recommended for production use. For more information, see the [account requirements in the Collator Requirements](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#account-requirements){target=\_blank}.

### Generate Session Keys {: #generate-session-keys }

To match the Substrate standard, Moonbeam collator's session keys are [SR25519](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-cryptography/#what-is-sr25519-and-where-did-it-come-from){target=\_blank}. This guide will show you how you can create/rotate your session keys associated with your collator node.

First, make sure you're [running a collator node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/){target=\_blank}. Once you have your collator node running, your terminal should print similar logs:

</div>

Next, session keys can be created/rotated by sending an RPC call to the HTTP endpoint with the `author_rotateKeys` method. When you call `author_rotateKeys`, the result is the size of two keys. The response will contain a concatenated Nimbus ID and VRF key. The Nimbus ID will be used to sign blocks and the [VRF](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/web3-and-polkadot/#vrf){target=\_blank} key is required for block production. The concatenated keys will be used to create an association to your H160 account for block rewards to be paid out.

For reference, if your collator's HTTP endpoint is at port `9944`, the JSON-RPC call might look like this:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9944 -H \
"Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"author_rotateKeys",
    "params": []
  }'
```

The collator node should respond with the concatenated public keys of your new session keys. The first 64 hexadecimal characters after the `0x` prefix represent your Nimbus ID and the last 64 hexadecimal characters are the public key of your VRF session key. You'll use the concatenated public keys when mapping your Nimbus ID and setting the session keys in the next section.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>curl http://127.0.0.1:9933-H\ "Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \</span>

</div>

Make sure you write down the concatenated public keys. Each of your servers, your primary and backup, should have their own unique keys. Since the keys never leave your servers, you can consider them a unique ID for that server.

Next, you'll need to register your session keys and map them to an H160 Ethereum-styled address to which the block rewards are paid.

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

To get started, get a copy of [`AuthorMappingInterface.sol`](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/author-mapping/AuthorMappingInterface.sol){target=\_blank} and take the following steps:

1. Click on the **File explorer** tab
2. Copy and paste the file contents into a [Remix file](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank} named `AuthorMappingInterface.sol`

![Copying and Pasting the Author Mapping Interface into Remix](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/author-mapping/author-mapping-1.webp)

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract }

1. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
2. Then to compile the interface, click on **Compile AuthorMappingInterface.sol**

![Compiling AuthorMappingInterface.sol](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/author-mapping/author-mapping-2.webp)

### Access the Contract {: #access-the-contract }

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab, directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Note: you are not deploying a contract here, instead you are accessing a precompiled contract that is already deployed
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - Metamask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** drop down
3. Ensure **AuthorMappingInterface.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Since this is a precompiled contract there is no need to deploy, instead you are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
4. Provide the address of the author mapping precompile for Moonbase Alpha: `{{networks.moonbase.precompiles.author_mapping}}` and click **At Address**

![Provide the address](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/author-mapping/author-mapping-3.webp)

The author mapping precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Map Session Keys {: #map-session-keys }

The next step is to map your session keys to your H160 account (an Ethereum-style address). Make sure you hold the private keys to this account, as this is where the block rewards are paid out to.

To map your session keys to your account, you need to be inside the [candidate pool](/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/#become-a-candidate){target=\_blank}. Once you are a candidate, you need to send a mapping extrinsic. Note that this will bond tokens per author ID registered.

Before getting started, ensure you're connected to the account that you want to map your session keys to. This will be the account where you will receive block rewards.

1. Expand the **AUTHORMAPPING** contract
2. Expand the **setKeys** method
3. Enter your session keys
4. Click **transact**
5. Confirm the MetaMask transaction that appears by clicking **Confirm**

![Map your session keys](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/author-mapping/author-mapping-4.webp)

To verify you have mapped your session keys successfully, you can use either the `mappingWithDeposit` method or the `nimbusLookup` method of the [author mapping pallet](/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/#author-mapping-interface){target=\_blank}. To do so, please refer to the [Check Mappings section of the Collator Account Management guide](/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/#check-the-mappings){target=\_blank}.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Collators are an integral part of the parachains they take part in. They receive transactions and create state transition proofs for the relay chain validators.

Running a Moonbeam collator requires Linux systems administration skills, careful monitoring, and an attention to detail. Below are some tips and tricks that have been accumulated which should help you get up and running quickly.

## Q & A

**Q: Where can I get help?**

**A:** There is an active and friendly [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank} community for collators. Join the server and introduce yourself even before you need help. Send **gilmouta** or **artkaseman** a DM and let them know who you are, and they can reach out to you if they see any issues with your node.

***

**Q: How do I stay up to date?**

**A:** All upgrades and important technical information are announced on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PhfEbKYqak){target=\_blank}, in the **#tech-upgrades-announcements** channel. Join and follow this channel. You can set up integrations to Slack or Telegram if those are your preferred communication channels.

***

**Q: How do I register my node?**

**A:** There is a [questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjmcXdiOXWtquYlBhdgXBunCKWHadaQCgPuBtzih1fd0W3aA/viewform){target=\_blank}, in which you will be able to provide your contact information as well as some basic hardware specs. You must be running a collator node on Moonbase Alpha to fill out the questionnaire.

***

**Q: What are the hardware requirements?**

**A:** Running a collator requires top of the line hardware to be able to process transactions and maximize your rewards. This is a very important factor in block production and rewards.

Run a systemd service on a top of the line bare-metal machine (i.e. run a physical server, not a cloud VM, or a docker container). You can run your own, or select a provider to manage the server for you.

Run only one service at a time per bare-metal machine. Do not run multiple instances.

***

**Q: What is the recommended hardware to run a collator?**

**A:**

Hardware recommendations:

- Top of the line CPU:
    - Ryzen 9 5950x or 5900x
    - Intel Xeon E-2386 or E-2388
- Primary and backup bare metal servers in different data centers and countries (Hetzner is OK for one of them)
- Dedicated server for Moonbeam that isn't shared with any other apps
- 1 TB NVMe SSD
- 32 GB RAM

***

**Q: What about backup nodes?**

**A:** Run two bare-metal machines of the same specifications, in different countries and service providers. If your primary fails you can quickly resume services on your backup and continue to produce blocks and earn rewards. Please refer to the Q&A on [failovers](#:~:text=What is the failover process if my Primary node is down) below.

***

**Q: What are the different networks?**

**A:** There are three networks, and each requires dedicated hardware. The Moonbase Alpha TestNet is free and should be used to familiarize yourself with the setup.

- **Moonbeam** - production network on Polkadot
- **Moonriver** - production network on Kusama
- **Moonbase Alpha TestNet** - development network

***

**Q: What ports do I allow on my firewall?**

**A:**

- Allow all incoming requests on TCP ports {{ networks.parachain.p2p }} and {{ networks.relay_chain.p2p }}
- Allow requests from your management IPs on TCP port 22
- Drop all other ports

***

**Q: Is there a CPU optimized binary?**

**A:** On each [release page](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank} are CPU optimized binaries. Select the binary for your CPU architecture.

- **Moonbeam-znver3** - Ryzen 9
- **Moonbeam-skylake** - Intel
- **Moonbeam** - generic can be used for all others

***

**Q: What are the recommendations on monitoring my node?**

**A:** Monitoring is very important for the health of the network and to maximize your rewards. We recommend using [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com){target=\_blank}. They have a free tier which should handle 6+ moonbeam servers.

***

**Q: What are the KPIs I should be monitoring?**

**A:** The main key performance indicator is blocks produced. The prometheus metric for this is called `substrate_proposer_block_constructed_count`.  

***

**Q: How should I setup alerting?**

**A:** Alerting is critical to keeping your moonbeam node producing blocks and earning rewards. We recommend [pagerduty.com](https://www.pagerduty.com){target=\_blank}, which is supported by [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com){target=\_blank}. Use the [KPI query](#:~:text=substrate_proposer_block_constructed_count) above and set an alert when this drops below 1. The alert should page the person on-call 24/7.  

***

**Q: What are Nimbus keys?**

**A:** Nimbus keys are just like [session keys in Polkadot](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-cryptography/#session-keys){target=\_blank}. You should have unique keys on your primary and backup servers. Save the key output somewhere safe where you can access it in the middle of the night if you receive an alert. To create your keys, please refer to the [Session Keys](/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/#session-keys){target=\_blank} section of the documentation.

***

**Q: What is the failover process if my primary node is down?**

**A:** When the primary server is down, the best way to perform a failover to the backup server is to perform a key association update. Each server should have a unique set of [keys](#:~:text=What are Nimbus keys) already. Run the `setKeys` author mapping extrinsic. You can follow the [Mapping Extrinsic](/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/#mapping-extrinsic){target=\_blank} instructions and modify the instructions to use the `setKeys` extrinsic.

***

**Q: Should I set up centralized logging?**

**A:** [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com){target=\_blank} can also be configured for centralized logging and is recommended. You can see all your nodes in one place. [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana){target=\_blank} has a more robust centralized logging offering, but Grafana is simple and good enough to start.

***

**Q: What should I look for in the logs?**

**A:** Logs are very useful to determine if you are in sync and ready to join the collators pool. Look at the tail end of the logs to determine if: 

1. Your Relay chain is in sync
2. Your parachain is in sync

You should see **Idle** in your logs when your node is in sync.

![In sync Relay chain and parachain](/images/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/account-1.webp)

A common issue is joining the pool before your node is in sync. You will be unable to produce any blocks or receive any rewards. Wait until you are in sync and idle before joining the candidate pool.

</div>

The relay chain takes much longer to sync than the parachain. You will not see any finalized blocks until the relay chain has synced.

***

**Q: How much is the bond to become a collator?**

**A:** There are two bonds you need to be aware of. Make sure your node is configured and in sync before proceeding with these steps.

The first is the [bond to join the collators](/node-operators/networks/collators/activities/#become-a-candidate){target=\_blank} pool:

- **Moonbeam** - minimum of {{ networks.moonbeam.staking.min_can_stk }} GLMR
- **Moonriver** - minimum of {{ networks.moonriver.staking.min_can_stk }} MOVR
- **Moonbase Alpha** - minimum of {{ networks.moonbase.staking.min_can_stk }} DEV

The second is the [bond for key association](/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/#mapping-bonds){target=\_blank}:

- **Moonbeam** - minimum of {{ networks.moonbeam.staking.collator_map_bond }} GLMR
- **Moonriver** - minimum of {{ networks.moonriver.staking.collator_map_bond }} MOVR
- **Moonbase Alpha** - minimum of {{ networks.moonbase.staking.collator_map_bond }} DEV

***

**Q: How do I set an identity on my collator account?**  

**A:** Setting an identity on chain will help to identify your node and attract delegations. You can set an identity by following the instructions on the [Managing an Identity](/tokens/manage/identity/){target=\_blank} page of our documentation.

# Moonbeam Orbiter Program

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Moonbeam Foundation is announcing a limited trial of the orbiter program. Similar to [Decentralized Nodes](https://nodes.web3.foundation/){target=\_blank}, this program allows collators to participate in the diversity and security of the network even if they do not have enough funds or backing to otherwise be in the active set. This program was developed with the input from the community.

The Moonbeam Foundation will maintain orbiter pools in the active set, and will assign authority to produce blocks to each of the members in the program, who are called orbiters. 

The active orbiter will rotate on a regular fixed basis to maintain a fair distribution of active rounds. The orbiters’ performance will be monitored and payouts for each round will be redirected to each orbiter based on their blocks produced that round. Rewards overall will be shared with all other orbiters assigned to each specific collator account. 

As long as an orbiter’s performance is within a range of their peers, they will maintain their position in the rotation. If they fall below this threshold, they will be removed from the pool and demoted to the back of the waiting list for Moonbase Alpha. A new orbiter from the waiting list will take their slot. 

## Duration {: #duration }

As the program progresses, the Moonbeam Foundation will assess the results and make adjustments. There is no specific end date, but the program may come to an end or materially change. Participants are both encouraged to give feedback throughout the program as well as be aware that it may change from the concept explained here.

## Eligibility {: #eligibility }

To participate in the orbiter program, you must meet the following eligibility criteria:

- Due to the nature of the program, each orbiter must pass an identity verification check, and cannot be a resident of certain jurisdictions
- Each orbiter must post a bond. This bond is posted to protect against bad behavior and will be subject to slashing
- Each entity (person or group) may only run one orbiter per network (i.e., one on Moonriver and one on Moonbeam)
- Orbiters cannot run another active collator on the same network as their orbiter. They can, however, run an active collator on Moonbeam and an orbiter on Moonriver, or vice versa, as long as they do not also have both on the same network

## Communication {: #communication }

A private discord group will be created for this program, and most communication will happen over this channel or through DM. Once you've filled out your application, you'll be added to the group.

## Orbiters and Orbiter Pool Configurations {: #configuration }

Orbiter pools are maintained by the Moonbeam Foundation, and will assign block production authority to each orbiter. The maximum number of orbiters per orbiter pool for each network is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.orbiter.max_orbiters_per_collator }} orbiters per pool
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.orbiter.max_orbiters_per_collator }} orbiters per pool
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.orbiter.max_orbiters_per_collator }} orbiters per pool
    ```

For Moonbeam and Moonriver there is also a maximum number of orbiter pools that will be allowed in the active set. For Moonbase Alpha, there will be as many orbiter pools as needed. The maximum is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.orbiter.max_collators }} orbiter pools
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.orbiter.max_collators }} orbiter pools
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.orbiter.max_collators }} orbiter pools
    ```

Each orbiter will be active for a certain number of rounds before the next orbiter will take over. The number of active rounds for each network is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.orbiter.active.rounds }} round (~{{ networks.moonbeam.orbiter.active.hours }} hours)
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.orbiter.active.rounds }} rounds (~{{ networks.moonriver.orbiter.active.hours }} hours)
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.orbiter.active.rounds }} rounds (~{{ networks.moonbase.orbiter.active.hours }} hours)
    ```

## Application and Onboarding Process {: #application-and-onboarding-process }

To join the orbiter program, you'll need to start by filling out an application where you'll need to submit contact information, social media handles, and collator and node details. At the end of the form, you'll also need to follow the instructions to complete identity verification.

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewdSAFgs0ZbgvlflmZbHrSpe6uH9HdXdGIL7i07AB2pFgxVQ/viewform" target="_blank" class="md-button">Moonbeam Orbiter Program Application</a>
</div>

Once you've passed identity verification and have been accepted into the program, you'll be notified and then the onboarding process will begin. New orbiters must run a Moonbase Alpha node for two weeks to be eligible to run a Moonriver node. Orbiters then must run a Moonriver node for four weeks to be eligible to run a Moonbeam node. Once you are eligible, you are not required to run orbiters on any network. You can leave other networks at any time by [unregistering](#leaving-the-program) and you will receive your bond back. To join again on that network you will need to re-register and will be at the end of the queue.

An outline of the onboarding process is as follows:

- [Prepare your node by syncing it](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/){target=\_blank}
- Once fully synced, you can [generate your session keys](/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/#session-keys){target=\_blank}
- [Register your session keys](/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/#map-author-id-set-session-keys){target=\_blank} and post the associated [mapping bond](#mapping-bond)
- Once you are ready, register as an orbiter via the `moonbeamOrbiters.orbiterRegister()` extrinsic and post the associated [orbiter bond](#bond)
- Orbiters will be placed in a waiting list for each network until a slot is available
- Once a slot opens up, you'll begin producing blocks and receiving rewards on the respective network

## Bonds {: #bond }

### Mapping Bond {: #mapping-bond}

There is a bond that is sent when mapping your author ID with your account. This bond is per author ID registered. The bond set is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.staking.collator_map_bond }} GLMR
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.staking.collator_map_bond }} MOVR
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.staking.collator_map_bond }} DEV
    ``` 

### Orbiter Bond {: #orbiter-bond }

As previously mentioned, each orbiter must submit a bond to join the program. This bond differs from the one for the active set as it does not earn any delegation rewards while bonded. The current bonds are as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.orbiter.bond }} GLMR
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.orbiter.bond }} MOVR
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.orbiter.bond }} DEV
    ```

## Rewards {: #rewards }

Rewards for orbiters will be split between the other orbiters assigned to the same orbiter pool. The maximum orbiters per orbiter pool is described in the [configuration section](#configuration). In the case of Moonriver it’s {{ networks.moonriver.orbiter.max_orbiters_per_collator }}, so the rewards will be approximately 1/{{ networks.moonriver.orbiter.max_orbiters_per_collator }} of a collator’s rewards. The blocks produced by each orbiter while active are tracked, and rewards are proportionally distributed.

## Performance Metrics {: #performance-metrics }

Each orbiter’s performance will be assessed over a period of time to determine they are active and producing blocks, and if their performance is within a range of all other orbiter pool collators. Orbiters are expected to run top tier hardware to stay within range. For more information on hardware requirements, please check out the [Collator Requirements page](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/){target=\_blank}. 

Metrics will be assessed over seven day periods. The performance metrics are as follows:

- Orbiter has produced a block within the last three rounds they were active 
- Orbiter’s block production is within two standard deviation of the seven day program mean
- Orbiter’s transactions per block is within two standard deviation of the seven day program mean 
- Orbiter’s block weight is within two standard deviation of the seven day program mean

!!! note
    These factors are subject to change as the program progresses.

## Leaving the Program {: #leaving-the-program }

An orbiter may leave the program and receive their bond back without any delay. The only limitation on this is if the orbiter is currently active they cannot leave; once they are no longer active they can leave at any time by issuing the `moonbeamOrbiters.orbiterUnregister()` extrinsic.

# Run a Collator on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Collators are members of the network that maintain the parachains they take part in. They run a full node (for both their particular parachain and the relay chain), and they produce the state transition proof for relay chain validators.

There are some [requirements](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/){target=\_blank} that need to be considered prior to becoming a collator candidate including machine, bonding, account, and community requirements.

Candidates will need a minimum amount of tokens bonded (self-bonded) to be considered eligible. Only a certain number of the top collator candidates by total stake, including self-bonded and delegated stake, will be in the active set of collators. Otherwise, the collator will remain in the candidate pool.

Once a candidate is selected to be in the active set of collators, they are eligible to produce blocks.

Moonbeam uses the Nimbus Parachain Consensus Framework. This provides a two-step filter to allocate candidates to the active set of collators, then assign collators to a block production slot:

 - The parachain staking filter selects the top candidates in terms of tokens staked in each network. For the exact number of top candidates per each network and the minimum bond amount, you can check out the [Minimum Collator Bond](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#minimum-collator-bond){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. This filtered pool is called selected candidates (also known as the active set), which are rotated every round
 - The fixed size subset filter picks a pseudo-random subset of the previously selected candidates for each block production slot

Users can spin up full nodes on Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha and activate the `collate` feature to participate in the ecosystem as collator candidates. To do this, you can checkout the [Run a Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation and spin up a node using either [Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/){target=\_blank} or [Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/){target=\_blank}.

## Join the Discord {: #join-discord }

As a collator, it is important to keep track of updates and changes to configuration. It is also important to be able to easily contact us and vice versa in case there is any issue with your node, as that will not only negatively affect collator and delegator rewards, it will also negatively affect the network.

For this purpose, we use [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/moonbeam){target=\_blank}. The most relevant Discord channels for collators are the following:

 - **tech-upgrades-announcements** — here we will publish any updates or changes in configuration changes collators will be required to follow. We will also announce any technical issues to monitor, such as network stalls
 - **collators** — this is the general collator discussion channel. We are proud of having an active and friendly collator community so if you have any questions, this is the place to ask. We will also ping collators here for any issues that require their attention.
 - **meet-the-collators** — in this channel you can introduce yourself to potential delegators

After you join Discord, feel free to DM *gilmouta* or *artkaseman* and introduce yourself. This will help the team identify who to contact if issues arise with your node and will enable assignment of the relevant Discord collator role, allowing you to post in *meet-the-collators*.

# Collator Requirements

## Introduction {: #introduction }

There are some requirements to keep in mind before diving into running a collator node. Primarily, you need to follow the community guidelines and meet the technical requirements. You should have top of the line hardware, securely created and stored accounts, meet bonding requirements, and fill out a collator questionnaire.

It is recommended to go through all of the necessary requirements on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet before collating on a production network like Moonbeam or Moonriver.

This guide will help you to get started fulfilling the collator requirements so you can get your node up and running in no time.

## Community Guidelines {: #community-guidelines }

Collators have a responsibility to the network to act honorably. If any of the following forbidden offenses occur, action may be taken via on-chain governance:

- An entity is running more than four collators in either network
- A collator is running multiple nodes using the same Nimbus key causing equivocation. Equivocation is the action of submitting multiple blocks at the same block height, which forks the network. It is strictly forbidden due to the network degradation that it implies. This can be done by a malicious actor (trying to get more blocks included/produced) or by mistake (having a backup node running with the same key). Each node needs to have its own unique keys and any backup solutions need to ensure there can be no possibility of equivocation
- A collator acts in a nefarious manner that is uncharitable to the community or other collators

There is a level of commitment to the community and the network that is necessary to gain trust from the community of delegators and attract more delegations. The following contains some suggestions for contributing to the community:

- Be active in the community
    - [Join the Discord](/node-operators/networks/collators/overview/#join-discord){target=\_blank} and introduce yourself, provide updates as needed, and help support community members or other collators
- Create tutorials and educational content
- [Become a Moonbeam Ambassador](https://moonbeam.network/community/ambassador){target=\_blank}
- Contribute to open-source software relating to the ecosystem
- Actively participate in governance and vote on proposals

## Hardware Requirements {: #hardware-requirements }

Collators must have a full node running with the collation options. To do so, follow the [Run a Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/) tutorial and installation steps for [Using Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/). Make sure you use the specific code snippets for collators.

!!! note
    Running a **collator** node has higher CPU requirements than the ones provided in the above tutorial. In order for your collator node to be able to keep up with a high transaction throughput a CPU with high clock speed and single-core performance is important, as the block production/import process is almost entirely single-threaded.
    Running your collator node in Docker is also not recommended, as it will have a significant impact in performance.

From a hardware perspective, it is important to have top of the line hardware to maximize block production and rewards. The following are some hardware recommendations that have performed well and provided the best results:

- **Recommended CPUs** - Intel Xeon E-2386/2388 or Ryzen 9 5950x/5900x
- **Recommended NVMe** - 1 TB NVMe
- **Recommended RAM** - 32 GB RAM

In addition, you should take into account the following considerations:

- As most cloud providers focus on multi-thread rather than single-thread performance, using a bare-metal provider is recommended
- You should have primary and backup bare metal servers in different data centers and countries. Hetzner is OK for one of these servers, but shouldn't be used for both
- Your Moonbeam server should be dedicated for Moonbeam only, please do not use the same server for other apps

## Account Requirements {: #account-requirements }

Similar to Polkadot validators, you need to create an account. For Moonbeam, this is an H160 account or an Ethereum-style account from which you hold the private keys. As a collator, you are responsible for correctly managing your own keys. Incorrectly doing so can result in a loss of funds.

There are many Ethereum wallets that can be used, but for production purposes it is recommended to generate keys as securely as possible. It is also recommended to generate backup keys. You can actually generate keys using the Moonbeam binary through a tool called Moonkey. It can be used to generate both Ethereum-style accounts and Substrate-style accounts.

To generate keys securely it is recommended to do so on an air-gapped machine. Once you generate your keys, make sure you store them safely. To securely store your keys, here are some recommendations, from least to most secure:

- Write down and laminate your keys
- Engrave your keys into a metal plate
- Shard your keys using a tool like [Horcrux](https://gitlab.com/unit410/horcrux){target=\_blank}

As always, it is recommended to do your own research and use tools that you vet as trustworthy.

### Getting Started with Moonkey {: #getting-started-with-moonkey }

The first step is to fetch the moonkey binary file hosted on GitHub. To do so, you can download a binary file (tested on Linux/Ubuntu):

`https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/download/v0.8.0/moonkey`

Once you’ve downloaded the tool, ensure you have the correct access permissions to execute the binary file. Next, check that you have the right version by checking the downloaded file hash.

For Linux-based systems such as Ubuntu, open the terminal and head to the folder where the moonkey binary file is located. Once there, you can use the sha256sum tool to calculate the SHA256 hash:

```text
019c3de832ded3fccffae950835bb455482fca92714448cc0086a7c5f3d48d3e
```

After you’ve verified the hash, it is recommended to move the binary file to an air-gapped machine (no network interfaces). You can also check the hash of the file in the air-gapped device directly.

### Generating an Account with Moonkey {: #generating-an-account-with-moonkey }

Using the moonkey binary file is very straightforward. Every time you execute the binary, the information related to a newly created account is displayed.

This information includes:

- **Mnemonic seed** - a 24-word mnemonic that represents your account in readable words. This gives direct access to your funds, so you need to store these words securely
- **Private key** - the private key associated with your account, used for signing. This is derived from the mnemonic seed. This gives direct access to your funds, so you need to store it securely
- **Public address** - your account’s address
- **Derivation path** - tells the Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet how to derive the specific key

!!! note
    Please safely store the private key/mnemonic and do not share it with anyone. Private keys/mnemonics provide direct access to your funds.

It is recommended that you use the binary file in an air-gapped machine.

### Other Moonkey Features {: #other-moonkey-features }

Moonkey provides some additional functionalities. The following flags can be provided:

- `-help` – prints help information
- `-version` – prints version of moonkey you are running
- `-w12` – generates a 12 words mnemonic seed (default is 24)

The following options are available:

- `-account-index` – provide as input the account index to use in the derivation path
- `-mnemonic` – provide as input the mnemonic

## Bonding Requirements {: #bonding-requirements }

There are two bonds for you to be aware of: a bond to join the collator pool and a bond for key association.

### Minimum Collator Bond {: #minimum-collator-bond }

First, you will need a minimum amount of tokens staked (self-bonded) to be considered eligible and become a candidate. Only a certain number of the top collator candidates by total stake, including self-bonded and delegated stake (total bonded), will be in the active set of collators.

    |      Active set size      | {{ networks.moonbase.staking.max_candidates }} collators |

### Key Association Bond {: #key-association-bond }

Secondly, you will need a bond for key association. This bond is required when [mapping your author ID](/node-operators/networks/collators/account-management/){target=\_blank} (session keys) with your account for block rewards, and is per author ID registered.

## Collator Questionnaire {: #collator-questionnaire }

There is a [Collator Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjmcXdiOXWtquYlBhdgXBunCKWHadaQCgPuBtzih1fd0W3aA/viewform){target=\_blank}, that aims to assess the state of all collators on Moonbase Alpha. You should be running a collator node on Moonbase Alpha before filling out this form. You will be able to provide your contact information as well as some basic hardware specs. It provides a way to open the lines of communication between you and the Moonbeam team in case any problems with your node arise.

# Manually Compile the Moonbeam Binary

## Introduction

Running a full node on a Moonbeam-based network allows you to connect to the network, sync with a boot node, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, author blocks on the parachain, and more.

This guide is meant for people with experience compiling [Substrate](https://docs.polkadot.com/){target=\_blank}-based blockchain nodes. A parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node will be a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself as well as code to sync the relay chain and facilitate communication between the two. This build is quite large, may take over 30 minutes, and requires at least 32 GB of memory.

To get started quickly without the hassle of compiling the binary yourself, you can use [The Release Binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/){target=\_blank}.

## Compile the Binary {: #compile-the-binary }

Manually compiling the binary can take around 30 minutes and requires 32GB of memory.

The following commands will build the latest release of the Moonbeam parachain.

1. Clone the Moonbeam repo.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam
    cd moonbeam
    ```

2. Check out the latest release.

    ```bash
    git checkout tags/$(git describe --tags)
    ```

3. Skip the next two steps if you already have Rust installed. Otherwise, install Rust and its prerequisites [via Rust's recommended method](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/){target=\_blank}.

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

4. Update your `PATH` environment variable.

    ```bash
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

5. Build the parachain binary.

    !!! note
        If you are using Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04, then you will need to install these additional dependencies before building the binary:

        ```bash
        apt install clang protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev pkg-config libssl-dev -y 
        ```

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

![Compiling Binary](/images/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/compile-binary/full-node-binary-1.webp)

If a _cargo not found error_ shows up in the terminal, manually add Rust to your system path or restart your system:

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Now you can use the Moonbeam binary to run a Systemd service. To set up the service and run it, please refer to the [Run a Node on Moonbeam Using Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/){target=\_blank} guide.

# Run a Node on Moonbeam Using Docker

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Running a full node on a Moonbeam-based network allows you to connect to the network, sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, author blocks on the parachain, and more.

In this guide, you'll learn how to quickly spin up a Moonbeam node using [Docker](https://www.docker.com){target=\_blank} and how to maintain and purge your node.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To get started, you'll need to:

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/){target=\_blank}. At the time of writing, the Docker version used was 24.0.6
- Make sure that your system meets the [requirements](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/#requirements){target=\_blank}. When connecting to Moonriver on Kusama or Moonbeam on Polkadot, it will take a few days to completely sync the embedded relay chain

## Set up Storage for Chain Data {: #storage-chain-data }

To set up the directory for storing chain data, you'll need to:

1. Create a local directory

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        mkdir {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        mkdir {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        mkdir {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}
        ```

2. Set the ownership and permissions for the local directory that stores the chain data. You can set the permissions either for a specific or current user (replace `INSERT_DOCKER_USER` for the actual user that will run the `docker` command)

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        # chown to a specific user
        chown INSERT_DOCKER_USER {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}

        # chown to current user
        sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        # chown to a specific user
        chown INSERT_DOCKER_USER {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}

        # chown to current user
        sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        # chown to a specific user
        chown INSERT_DOCKER_USER {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}

        # chown to current user
        sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}
        ```

## Start-up Commands {: #start-up-commands }

To spin up your node, you'll need to execute the `docker run` command. If you're setting up a collator node, make sure to follow the code snippets for [collators](#collator-node).

Note that in the following start-up command, you have to:

- Replace `INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME` with your node name of choice. You'll have to do this in two places: one for the parachain and one for the relay chain
- Replace `INSERT_RAM_IN_MB` for 50% of the actual RAM your server has. For example, for 32GB of RAM, the value must be set to `16000`. The minimum value is `2000`, but it is below the recommended specs

For an overview of the flags used in the following start-up commands, plus additional commonly used flags, please refer to the [Flags](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/flags/){target=\_blank} page of our documentation.

!!! note "For Apple Silicon users"
    If Docker commands fail or behave unexpectedly on Apple Silicon, enable **Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon** in Docker Desktop settings and use the `amd64` platform for both pull and run commands. For example:

    ```bash
    docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.moonbeam.parachain_release_tag }}
    ```

    ```bash
    docker run --platform=linux/amd64 ...
    ```

#### Allow External Access to Your Node {: #allow-external-access }

If you want to run an RPC endpoint, connect to Polkadot.js Apps, or run your own application, you can use the `--unsafe-rpc-external` flag to run the full node with external access to the RPC ports.

        -- \
        --name "INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME (Embedded Relay)" \
        --sync fast
        ```

#### Use a SQL Backend for Frontier {: #use-sql }

The default [Frontier](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/){target=\_blank} database, which comes standard with Moonbeam nodes and contains all of the Ethereum-related elements, such as transactions, blocks, and logs, can be modified to use a SQL backend. Since `eth_getLogs` is a very resource-intensive method, the SQL backend aims to provide a more performant alternative for indexing and querying Ethereum logs in comparison to the default RocksDB database.

To spin up a node with a Frontier SQL backend, you'll need to add the `--frontier-backend-type sql` flag to your start-up command.

There are additional flags you can use to configure the pool size, query timeouts, and more for your SQL backend; please refer to the [Flags](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/flags/#flags-for-sql-backend){target=\_blank} page for more information.

### Collator Node

Beginning with v0.39.0, new Moonbeam collator nodes will no longer generate session keys automatically on start-up. Nodes in existence prior to v0.39.0 do not need to make changes to how they handle session keys. 

When setting up a new node, run the following command to generate and store on disk the session keys that will be referenced in the start-up command: 

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash

    docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/moonbeam-data:/data" \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
     moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.moonbeam.parachain_release_tag }} key generate-node-key --base-path /var/lib/moonbeam-data --chain moonbeam 
    
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash

    docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/moonriver-data:/data" \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
     moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.moonriver.parachain_release_tag }} key generate-node-key --base-path /var/lib/moonriver-data --chain moonriver 

    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash

    docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/alphanet-data:/data" \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
     moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.moonbase.parachain_release_tag }} key generate-node-key --base-path /var/lib/alphanet-data --chain alphanet && sudo chown -R moonbase_service  /var/lib/alphanet-data

    ```

!!! note
    You need to [change ownership of the newly created folder](#storage-chain-data) to the specific user or current user for Docker. Node key generation steps can be bypassed using the `--unsafe-force-node-key-generation` parameter in the start-up command, although this is not the recommended practice.

Now you can run your Docker start up commands:

If you followed the installation instructions for Moonbase Alpha, once synced, you will have a node of the Moonbase Alpha TestNet running locally! For Moonbeam or Moonriver, once synced, you will be connected to peers and see blocks being produced on the network!

!!! note
    It may take a few days to completely sync the embedded relay chain. Make sure that your system meets the [requirements](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/#requirements){target=\_blank}.

## Maintain Your Node {: #maintain-your-node }

As Moonbeam development continues, it will sometimes be necessary to upgrade your node software. Node operators will be notified on our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank} when upgrades are available and whether they are necessary (some client upgrades are optional). The upgrade process is straightforward and is the same for a full node or collator.

1. Stop the Docker container:

    ```bash
    sudo docker stop INSERT_CONTAINER_ID
    ```

2. Get the latest version of Moonbeam from the [Moonbeam GitHub Release](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank} page
3. Use the latest version to spin up your node. To do so, replace the version in the start-up command with the latest and run it

Once your node is running again, you should see logs in your terminal.

## Purge Your Node {: #purge-your-node }

If you need a fresh instance of your Moonbeam node, you can purge your node by removing the associated data directory.

You'll first need to stop the Docker container:

```bash
  sudo docker stop INSERT_CONTAINER_ID
```

If you did not use the `-v` flag to specify a local directory for storing your chain data when you spun up your node, then the data folder is related to the Docker container itself. Therefore, removing the Docker container will remove the chain data.

If you did spin up your node with the `-v` flag, you will need to purge the specified directory. For example, for the suggested data directly, you can run the following command to purge your parachain and relay chain data:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/*
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/*
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/*
    ```

To only remove the parachain data for a specific chain, you can run:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/chains/*
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/chains/*
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/chains/*
    ```

Similarly, to only remove the relay chain data, you can run:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/polkadot/*
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/polkadot/*
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/polkadot/*
    ```

Now that your chain data has been purged, you can start a new node with a fresh data directory. You can install the newest version by repeating the instructions in this guide. Make sure you are using the latest tag available, which you can find on the [Moonbeam GitHub Release](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases) page.

!!! note
    On an as-needed basis, Moonbase Alpha might be purged and reset. In these instances, you will need to purge both the parachain data and the relay chain data. If a purge is required, node operators will be notified in advance (via our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank}).

# Helpful Flags for Running a Node on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

When spinning up your own Moonbeam node, there are some required and optional flags that can be used. This guide will cover some of the most common flags and show you how to access all of the available flags.

## Common Flags {: #common-flags }

- **`--collator`**: Enables collator mode for collator candidates and, if eligible, allows the node to actively participate in block production.
- **`--port`**: Specifies the peer-to-peer protocol TCP port. The default port for parachains is `{{ networks.parachain.p2p }}` and `{{ networks.relay_chain.p2p }}` for the embedded relay chain.
- **`--rpc-port`**: Sets the unified port for both HTTP and WS connections. The default port for parachains is `{{ networks.parachain.rpc }}` and `{{ networks.relay_chain.ws }}` for the embedded relay chain.
- **`--ws-port`**: *deprecated as of [client v0.33.0](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/v0.33.0){target=\_blank}, use `--rpc-port` for HTTP and WS connections instead* - Sets the unified port for both HTTP and WS connections. The default port for parachains is `{{ networks.parachain.ws }}`  and `{{ networks.relay_chain.ws }}` for the embedded relay chain.
- **`--rpc-max-connections`**: Specifies the maximum number of HTTP and WS server connections. The default is 100.
- **`--rpc-external`** — Listen on all interfaces for JSON-RPC (HTTP & WS). Use a proxy to filter unsafe methods on public endpoints. Use **`--unsafe-rpc-external`** to suppress the safety warning if you accept the risk.
- **`--rpc-methods`** — Which RPC methods to expose. Options: `auto` *(default)*, `safe`, `unsafe`.
- **`--rpc-cors`** — Comma-separated allowed browser origins (`protocol://domain`) or `all` to disable validation. In `--dev`, default allows all origins.
- **`--rpc-rate-limit <calls/min>`** — Per-connection rate limit. Disabled by default.  
  - **`--rpc-rate-limit-whitelisted-ips <CIDR>...`** — CIDR ranges exempt from the limit.  
  - **`--rpc-rate-limit-trust-proxy-headers`** — Trust `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` when behind a reverse proxy.
- **`--rpc-max-request-size <MB>`** / **`--rpc-max-response-size <MB>`** — Max payload sizes (default `15` / `15`).
- **`--rpc-max-subscriptions-per-connection <N>`** — Max concurrent subscriptions per connection (default `1024`).
- **`--rpc-message-buffer-capacity-per-connection <N>`** — Per-connection queued message capacity before back-pressure (default `64`).
- **`--rpc-disable-batch-requests`** and **`--rpc-max-batch-request-len <N>`** — Disable batch RPC or cap batch length.
- **`--ws-max-connections`**: *deprecated as of [client v0.33.0](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/v0.33.0){target=\_blank}, use `--rpc-max-connections` to adjust the combined HTTP and WS connection limit instead* - Specifies the maximum number of HTTP and WS server connections. The default is 100.
- **`--wasm-execution`**: Specifies the method for executing Wasm runtime code. The available options are:
    - **`compiled`**: This is the default and uses the [Wasmtime](https://github.com/paritytech/wasmtime){target=\_blank} compiled runtime.
    - **`interpreted-i-know-what-i-do`**: Uses the [wasmi interpreter](https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi){target=\_blank}.
- **`--wasmtime-instantiation-strategy`**: Controls WASM instantiation. Default is `pooling-copy-on-write` (fastest). Options include `recreate-instance-copy-on-write`, `pooling`, `recreate-instance`. CoW variants fall back where unsupported.
- **`--max-runtime-instances <N>`**: Size of the runtime instances cache per runtime. Default `8`, max `32`.
- **`--runtime-cache-size <N>`**: Max number of distinct runtimes cached simultaneously. Default `2`.  
- **`--wasmtime-precompiled <PATH>`** / **`--wasm-runtime-overrides <PATH>`**: Use precompiled runtimes or local WASM overrides when version matches. Advanced/ops use only.
- **`--state-pruning`**: Specifies the state pruning mode. For client versions prior to v0.27.0, the `--state-pruning` flag was named `--pruning`. If running a node with the `--collator` flag, the default is to keep the full state of all blocks. Otherwise, the state is only kept for the last 256 blocks. The available options are:
    - **`archive`**: Keeps the full state of all blocks.
    - **`<number-of-blocks>`**: Specifies a custom number of blocks to keep the state for.
- **`--trie-cache-size`**: Specifies the size of the internal state cache in bytes. The default is `1073741824` (1 GB). Providing `0` disables the cache. For performance on collators and RPC nodes, values around 1–4 GB are common, depending on hardware. (Prior to client v0.27.0 this was `--state-cache-size`.)
- **`--db-cache`**: Specifies the memory the database cache is limited to use. It is recommended to set it to 50% of the actual RAM your server has. For example, for 32 GB RAM, the value should be set to `16000`. The minimum value is `2000`, but it is below the recommended specs.
- **`--database`**: Selects the DB backend. Options: `auto` (detect or create ParityDb), `paritydb`, `paritydb-experimental`, `rocksdb`. For most operators, `auto` is fine; RocksDB may be preferred by some for tooling familiarity.
- **`--blocks-pruning`**: Prunes block bodies/justifications separately from state. Options:  
  - `archive`: keep all blocks,  
  - `archive-canonical`: keep finalized blocks only (default),  
  - `<NUMBER>`: keep the last `<NUMBER>` finalized blocks.
- **`--base-path`**: Specifies the base path where your chain data is stored.
- **`--chain`**: Specifies the chain specification to use. It can be a predefined chainspec such as `{{ networks.moonbeam.chain_spec }}`, `{{ networks.moonriver.chain_spec }}`, or `{{ networks.moonbase.chain_spec }}`. Or it can be a path to a file with the chainspec (such as the one exported by the `build-spec` command).
- **`--network-backend`**: Select the P2P stack. Options:  
  - `litep2p` (default) — lightweight, lower CPU usage, ecosystem is migrating here.  
  - `libp2p` — legacy backend kept for compatibility.
- **`--name`**: Specifies a human-readable name for the node, which can be seen on [telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io){target=\_blank}, if enabled.
- **`--telemetry-url`**: Specifies the URL of the telemetry server to connect to. This flag can be passed multiple times as a means to specify multiple telemetry endpoints. This flag takes two parameters: the URL and the verbosity level. Verbosity levels range from 0-9, with 0 denoting the least verbosity. Expected format is '<URL VERBOSITY>', e.g. `--telemetry-url 'wss://foo/bar 0'`.
- **`--no-telemetry`**: Disable telemetry entirely (it is on by default on global chains).
- **`--prometheus-external`**: Expose Prometheus metrics on all interfaces (default is local).
- **`--no-prometheus`**: Disable the Prometheus endpoint.
- **`--no-prometheus-prefix`**: Remove the `moonbeam` prefix from metric names.
- **`--in-peers`**: Specifies the maximum number of inbound full-node peers. The default is `32`.
- **`--out-peers`**: Specifies the target number of outbound peers to maintain. The default is `8`.
- **`--reserved-nodes <ADDR>...`** / **`--reserved-only`**: Pin to a set of peers and (optionally) sync **only** with them. Useful for private clusters or RPC nodes behind sentry/topology.
- **`--no-hardware-benchmarks`**: Skip automatic CPU/memory/disk benchmarks at startup (also suppresses sending these to telemetry if enabled).
- **`--public-addr <MULTIADDR>...`** / **`--listen-addr <MULTIADDR>...`**: Advertised vs listen multiaddresses for P2P. Use when behind NAT/proxies.
- **`--no-private-ip`** / **`--allow-private-ip`**: Forbid/allow private address peering depending on environment.
- **`--in-peers-light <N>`**: Max inbound light-client peers (default `100`).
- **`--max-parallel-downloads <N>`**: How many peers to request the same announced blocks from in parallel. Default `5`.
- **`--runtime-cache-size 64`**: Configures the number of different runtime versions preserved in the in-memory cache to 64.
- **`--eth-log-block-cache`**: Size in bytes the LRU cache for block data is limited to use. This flag mostly pertains to RPC providers. The default is `300000000`.
- **`--eth-statuses-cache`**: Size in bytes the LRU cache for transaction statuses data is limited to use. This flag mostly pertains to RPC providers. The default is `300000000`.
- **`--sync`**: Sets the blockchain syncing mode, which can allow for the blockchain to be synced faster. The available options are:
    - **`full`**: Downloads and validates the full blockchain history.
    - **`fast`**: Downloads blocks without executing them and downloads the latest state with proofs.
    - **`fast-unsafe`**: Same as `fast`, but skips downloading the state proofs.
    - **`warp`**: Downloads the latest state and proof.
- **`--prometheus-port`**: Specifies a custom Prometheus port.
- **`--lazy-loading-remote-rpc`**: Allows [lazy loading](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/#lazy-loading){target=\_blank} by relying on a specified RPC endpoint for network state until the node is fully synchronized e.g. `--lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com'`, as long as the specified RPC endpoint has sufficient rate limits to handle the expected load. Private (API key) endpoints are strongly recommended over public endpoints.
- **`--lazy-loading-block`**: Optional parameter to specify the block hash for lazy loading. This parameter allows you to specify a block hash from which to start loading data. If not provided, the latest block will be used.
- **`--lazy-loading-state-overrides`**: Optional parameter to specify state overrides during lazy loading. This parameter allows you to provide a path to a file containing state overrides. The file can contain any custom state modifications that should be applied.
- **`--lazy-loading-runtime-override`**: Optional parameter to specify a runtime override when starting the lazy loading. If not provided, it will fetch the runtime from the block being forked.
- **`--lazy-loading-delay-between-requests`**: The delay (in milliseconds) between RPC requests when using lazy loading. This parameter controls the amount of time to wait between consecutive RPC requests. This can help manage request rate and avoid overwhelming the server. Default value is `100` milliseconds.
- **`--lazy-loading-max-retries-per-request`**: The maximum number of retries for an RPC request when using lazy loading. Default value is `10` retries.
- **`--pool-type`**: Selects the transaction pool implementation. The available options are:
    - **`fork-aware`**: Tracks pending transactions across competing forks ("views"), which reduces dropped/re-validated transactions and nonce/order glitches during brief reorgs. This is the default on current Moonbeam builds (Polkadot SDK change; default from ~RT3600+) and is recommended on collators and RPC nodes.
    - **`single-state`**: Uses the legacy single-view pool. On older binaries, explicitly set `--pool-type=fork-aware` to opt in to the improved implementation.
- **`--pool-limit <N>`**: Max number of transactions in the pool. Default `8192`.
- **`--pool-kbytes <KB>`**: Max total size of pending transactions. Default `20480` (≈20 MB).
- **`--tx-ban-seconds <S>`**: How long to ban invalid transactions. Default `1800` seconds.
- **`--relay-chain-rpc-urls <URL>...`**: Reduce resource usage by fetching relay-chain data from remote RPC(s). The node will try the URLs in order and fall back if a connection fails. Still connects to the relay chain network but with lower bandwidth.
- **`--relay-chain-light-client`** (experimental, full nodes only): Embed a relay-chain light client. Uses the specified relay-chain chainspec.
- **`--offchain-worker <mode>`**: Enable offchain workers. Options: `always`, `never`, `when-authority` *(default)*.
- **`--enable-offchain-indexing <true|false>`**: Allow the runtime to write directly to the offchain workers DB during block import. Default `false`.


### Execution Strategy Flags {: #execution-strategy }

These tune how the runtime executes in different contexts:

- **`--execution`**: Global default for all contexts. Options: `native`, `wasm`, `both`, `native-else-wasm`.
- **`--execution-syncing`**, **`--execution-import-block`**, **`--execution-block-construction`**, **`--execution-offchain-worker`**, **`--execution-other`**: Override per-context behavior with the same option set as above.

`Native-else-wasm` and `both` can help diagnose native/wasm divergence during upgrades; `wasm` is safest but slower.


## Flags for Configuring a SQL Backend {: #flags-for-sql-backend }

- **`--frontier-backend-type`**: Sets the Frontier backend type to one of the following options:
    - **`key-value`**: Uses either RocksDB or ParityDB as per inherited from the global backend settings. This is the default option and RocksDB is the default backend.
    - **`sql`**: Uses a SQL database with custom log indexing.
- **`frontier-sql-backend-pool-size`**: Sets the Frontier SQL backend's maximum number of database connections that a connection pool can simultaneously handle. The default is `100`.
- **`frontier-sql-backend-num-ops-timeout`**: Sets the Frontier SQL backend's query timeout in number of VM operations. The default is `10000000`.
- **`frontier-sql-backend-thread-count`**: Sets the Frontier SQL backend's auxiliary thread limit. The default is `4`.
- **`frontier-sql-backend-cache-size`**: Sets the Frontier SQL backend's cache size in bytes. The default value is 200MB, which is `209715200` bytes.

## How to Access All of the Available Flags {: #how-to-access-all-of-the-available-flags }

# Run a Node on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Running a full node on a Moonbeam-based network allows you to connect to the network, sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, author blocks on the parachain, and more.

There are multiple deployments of Moonbeam, including the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, Moonriver on Kusama, and Moonbeam on Polkadot. Here's how these environments are named and their corresponding [chain specification file](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/deployment/generate-chain-specs/) names:

|    Network     |      Hosted By      |             Chain Name              |
|:--------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| Moonbase Alpha | Moonbeam Foundation | {{ networks.moonbase.chain_spec }}  |
|   Moonriver    |       Kusama        | {{ networks.moonriver.chain_spec }} |
|    Moonbeam    |      Polkadot       | {{ networks.moonbeam.chain_spec }}  |

!!! note
    Moonbase Alpha is still considered an Alphanet, and as such _will not_ have 100% uptime. The parachain might be purged as needed. During the development of your application, make sure you implement a method to redeploy your contracts and accounts to a fresh parachain quickly. If a chain purge is required, it will be announced via our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX) at least 24 hours in advance.

## Requirements {: #requirements }

Running a parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node is a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself, as well as code to sync the relay chain and facilitate communication between the two. As such, this build is quite large and may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory.

The minimum specs recommended to run a node are shown in the following table. For our Kusama and Polkadot MainNet deployments, disk requirements will be higher as the network grows.

!!! note
    If you don't see an `Imported` message (without the `[Relaychain]` tag) when running a node, you might need to double-check your port configuration.

## Running Ports {: #running-ports }

As stated before, the relay/parachain nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the parachain, while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P. **Collators must not have RPC or WS ports opened**.

!!! note
    As of client v0.33.0, the `--ws-port` and `--ws-max-connections` flags have been deprecated and removed in favor of the `--rpc-port` and `--rpc-max-connections` flags for both RPC and WSS connections. The default port is `9944`, and the default maximum number of connections is set to 100.

### Default Ports for a Parachain Full-Node {: #default-ports-for-a-parachain-full-node }

|  Description   |                Port                 |

|  **RPC & WS**  |     {{ networks.parachain.ws }}     |
| **Prometheus** | {{ networks.parachain.prometheus }} |

### Default Ports of Embedded Relay Chain {: #default-ports-of-embedded-relay-chain }

|  Description   |                 Port                  |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------------:|

## Installation {: #installation }

There are a couple different guides to help you get started running a Moonbeam-based node:

- [Using Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/) - this method provides a quick and easy way to get started with a Docker container
- [Using Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/) - this method is recommended for those with experience compiling a Substrate node

## Debug, Trace and TxPool APIs {: #debug-trace-txpool-apis }

You can also gain access to some non-standard RPC methods by running a tracing node, which allow developers to inspect and debug transactions during runtime. Tracing nodes use a different Docker image than a standard Moonbase Alpha, Moonriver, or Moonbeam node. Check out the [Run a Tracing Node](/node-operators/networks/tracing-node/) guide and be sure to switch to the right network tab throughout the instructions. Then to interact with your tracing node, check out the [Debug & Trace](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/) guide.

## Lazy Loading {: #lazy-loading }

Lazy loading lets a Moonbeam node operate while downloading network state in the background, eliminating the need to wait for full synchronization before use. You can activate lazy loading with the following flag:

- **`--lazy-loading-remote-rpc`** - allows lazy loading by relying on a specified RPC for network state until the node is fully synchronized e.g. `--lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT-RPC-URL'`

Upon spooling up a node with this feature, you'll see output like the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty>[Lazy loading 🌗]
    <br>You are now running the Moonbeam client in lazy loading mode, where data is retrieved
    <br>from a live RPC node on demand.
    <br>Using remote state from: https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com
    <br>Forking from block: 8482853
    <br>To ensure the client works properly, please note the following:
    <br>    1. *Avoid Throttling*: Ensure that the backing RPC node is not limiting the number of
    <br>    requests, as this can prevent the lazy loading client from functioning correctly;
    <br>    2. *Be Patient*: As the client may take approximately 20 times longer than normal to
    <br>    retrieve and process the necessary data for the requested operation.
    <br>The service will start in 10 seconds...</span>
</div>

!!! note
    Lazy loading a Moonbeam requires a large number of RPC requests. To avoid being rate-limited by a public endpoint, it's highly recommended to use a [dedicated endpoint](/builders/get-started/endpoints#endpoint-providers).  

You can further customize your use of the lazy loading functionality with the following optional parameters:

- **`--lazy-loading-block`** - specifies a block hash from which to start loading data. If not provided, the latest block will be used
- **`--lazy-loading-delay-between-requests`** - the delay (in milliseconds) between RPC requests when using lazy loading. This parameter controls the amount of time to wait between consecutive RPC requests. This can help manage request rate and avoid overwhelming the server. Default value is `100` milliseconds
- **`--lazy-loading-max-retries-per-request`** - the maximum number of retries for an RPC request when using lazy loading. Default value is `10` retries
- **`--lazy-loading-runtime-override`** - path to a WASM file to override the runtime when forking. If not provided, it will fetch the runtime from the block being forked
- **`--lazy-loading-state-overrides`** - path to a JSON file containing state overrides to be applied when forking 

The state overrides file should define the respective pallet, storage item, and value that you seek to override as follows:

```json
[
 {
     "pallet": "System",
     "storage": "SelectedCandidates",
     "value": "0x04f24ff3a9cf04c71dbc94d0b566f7a27b94566cac"
 }
]
```

## Logs and Troubleshooting {: #logs-and-troubleshooting }

You will see logs from both the relay chain and the parachain. The relay chain will be prefixed by `[Relaychain]`, while the parachain has no prefix.

### P2P Ports Not Open {: #p2p-ports-not-open }

If you don't see an `Imported` message (without the `[Relaychain]` tag), you need to check the P2P port configuration. P2P port must be open to incoming traffic.

### In Sync {: #in-sync }

Both chains must be in sync at all times, and you should see either `Imported` or `Idle` messages and have connected peers.

### Genesis Mismatching {: #genesis-mismatching }

The Moonbase Alpha TestNet may need to be purged and upgraded once in a while. Consequently, you may see the following message:

```text
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id `ID` is on a different
chain (our genesis: GENESIS_ID theirs: OTHER_GENESIS_ID)
```

This typically means that you are running an older version and will need to upgrade.

We announce the upgrades (and corresponding chain purge) via our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX) at least 24 hours in advance.

Instructions for purging chain data will vary slightly depending on how you spun up your node:

  - For Docker, you can check out the [Purge Your Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/#purge-your-node) section of the [Using Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/) page
  - For Systemd, you can take a look at the [Purge Your Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#purge-your-node) section of the [Using Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/) page

# Run a Node on Moonbeam Using Systemd

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Running a full node on a Moonbeam-based network allows you to connect to the network, sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, author blocks on the parachain, and more.

In this guide, you'll learn how to spin up a Moonbeam node using [Systemd](https://systemd.io){target=\_blank} and how to maintain and purge your node.

If you're interested in compiling the binary yourself, which may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory, you can check out the [Manually Compile the Moonbeam Binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/compile-binary/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

The following sections go through the process of using the binary and running a Moonbeam full node as a systemd service. To get started, you'll need to:

- Make sure you're running Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, or 22.04. Moonbeam may work with other Linux flavors, but Ubuntu is currently the only tested version
- Make sure that your system meets the [requirements](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/#requirements){target=\_blank}. When connecting to Moonriver on Kusama or Moonbeam on Polkadot, it will take a few days to completely sync the embedded relay chain

## Download the Latest Release Binary {: #the-release-binary }

To download the latest [release binary](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank}, take the following steps:

1. Create a directory to store the binary and chain data (you might need `sudo`)

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        mkdir {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        mkdir {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        mkdir {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}
        ```

2. Use `wget` to grab the latest [release binary](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank} and output it to the directory created in the previous step

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/download/{{ networks.moonbeam.parachain_release_tag }}/moonbeam \
        -O {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/download/{{ networks.moonriver.parachain_release_tag }}/moonbeam \
        -O {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ``` 

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/download/{{ networks.moonbase.parachain_release_tag }}/moonbeam \
        -O {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

3. To verify that you have downloaded the correct version, you can run the following command in your terminal

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        sha256sum {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        sha256sum {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        sha256sum {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    You should receive the following output:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```text
        {{ networks.moonbeam.parachain_sha256sum }}
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```text
        {{ networks.moonriver.parachain_sha256sum }}
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```text
        {{ networks.moonbase.parachain_sha256sum }}
        ```

## Set Up the Service {: #set-up-the-service }

The following commands will set up everything regarding running the service:

1. Create a service account to run the service

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        adduser moonbeam_service --system --no-create-home
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        adduser moonriver_service --system --no-create-home
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        adduser moonbase_service --system --no-create-home
        ```

2. Ensure that you properly configure the ownership and permissions for the local directory housing the chain data, and also remember to grant execute permission to the binary file

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        sudo chown -R moonbeam_service {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}
        sudo chmod +x {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        sudo chown -R moonriver_service {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}
        sudo chmod +x {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        sudo chown -R moonbase_service {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}
        sudo chmod +x {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

## Create the Configuration File {: #create-the-configuration-file }

Next, create the systemd service file. If you're configuring a collator node, use the [collator-specific](#collator) configuration snippets below.

First, you'll need to create a file named `/etc/systemd/system/moonbeam.service` to store the configurations.

Note that in the following start-up configurations, you have to:

- Replace `INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME` with your node name of choice. You'll have to do this in two places: one for the parachain and one for the relay chain
- Replace `INSERT_RAM_IN_MB` for 50% of the actual RAM your server has. For example, for 32GB of RAM, the value must be set to `16000`. The minimum value is `2000`, but it is below the recommended specs
- Double-check that the binary is in the proper path as described below (_ExecStart_)
- Double-check the base path if you've used a different directory

For an overview of the flags used in the following start-up commands, plus additional commonly used flags, please refer to the [Flags](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/flags/){target=\_blank} page of our documentation.

#### Allow External Access to Your Node {: #allow-external-access }

If you want to run an RPC endpoint, connect to Polkadot.js Apps, or run your own application, you can use the `--unsafe-rpc-external` flag to run the full node with external access to the RPC ports.

#### Use a SQL Backend for Frontier {: #use-sql }

The default [Frontier](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/){target=\_blank} database, which comes standard with Moonbeam nodes and contains all of the Ethereum-related elements, such as transactions, blocks, and logs, can be modified to use a SQL backend. Since `eth_getLogs` is a very resource-intensive method, the SQL backend aims to provide a more performant alternative for indexing and querying Ethereum logs in comparison to the default RocksDB database.

To spin up a node with a Frontier SQL backend, you'll need to add the `--frontier-backend-type sql` flag to your start-up command.

There are additional flags you can use to configure the pool size, query timeouts, and more for your SQL backend; please refer to the [Flags](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/flags/#flags-for-sql-backend){target=\_blank} page for more information.

    ```

### Collator {: #collator }

Beginning with v0.39.0, new Moonbeam collator nodes will no longer generate session keys automatically on start-up. Nodes in existence prior to v0.39.0 do not need to make changes to how they handle session keys.

When setting up a new node, run the following command to generate and store on disk the session keys that will be referenced in the start-up command:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash

    /var/lib/moonbeam-data/moonbeam key generate-node-key --base-path /var/lib/moonbeam-data --chain moonbeam && sudo chown -R moonbeam_service /var/lib/moonbeam-data
    
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash

    /var/lib/moonriver-data/moonbeam key generate-node-key --base-path /var/lib/moonriver-data --chain moonriver && sudo chown -R moonriver_service /var/lib/moonriver-data

    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash

    /var/lib/alphanet-data/moonbeam key generate-node-key --base-path /var/lib/alphanet-data --chain alphanet  && sudo chown -R moonbase_service  /var/lib/alphanet-data

    ```

!!! note
    This step can be bypassed using the `--unsafe-force-node-key-generation` parameter in the start-up command, although this is not the recommended practice.

Now you can create the systemd configuration file:

During the syncing process, you will see logs from both the embedded relay chain ([Relaychain]) and the parachain ([🌗]). These logs display a target block (live network state) and a best block (local node synced state).

!!! note
    It may take a few days to completely sync the embedded relay chain. Make sure that your system meets the [requirements](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/#requirements){target=\_blank}.

If you need to stop the service for any reason, you can run:

```bash
systemctl stop moonbeam.service
```

## Maintain Your Node {: #maintain-your-node }

As Moonbeam development continues, it will sometimes be necessary to upgrade your node software. Node operators will be notified on our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank} when upgrades are available and whether they are necessary (some client upgrades are optional). The upgrade process is straightforward and is the same for a full node or collator.

If you want to update your client, you can keep your existing chain data in tact, and only update the binary by following these steps:

1. Stop the systemd service

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop moonbeam.service
    ```

2. Remove the old binary file

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        rm {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        rm {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        rm {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

3. Get the latest version of the [Moonbeam release binary on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank} and run the following command to update to that version

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/download/INSERT_NEW_VERSION_TAG/moonbeam \
        -O {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/download/INSERT_NEW_VERSION_TAG/moonbeam \
        -O {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/download/INSERT_NEW_VERSION_TAG/moonbeam \
        -O {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    !!! note
        If you [compiled the binary manually](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/compile-binary/){target=\_blank}, you'll need to move the binary from `./target/release/{{ networks.moonbeam.binary_name }}` to the data directory.

4. Update permissions

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        chmod +x {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        chown moonbeam_service {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        chmod +x {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        chown moonriver_service {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        chmod +x {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        chown moonbase_service {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/moonbeam
        ```

5. Start your service

    ```bash
    systemctl start moonbeam.service
    ```

To check the status of the service and/or logs, you can refer to the [commands from before](#run-the-service).

## Purge Your Node {: #purge-your-node }

If you need a fresh instance of your Moonbeam node, you can purge your node by removing the associated data directory.

You'll first need to stop the systemd service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop moonbeam
```

To purge your parachain and relay chain data, you can run the following command:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/*
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/*
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/*
    ```

To only remove the parachain data for a specific chain, you can run:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/chains/*
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/chains/*
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/chains/*
    ```

Similarly, to only remove the relay chain data, you can run:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/polkadot/*
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/polkadot/*
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/polkadot/*
    ```

Now that your chain data has been purged, you can start a new node with a fresh data directory. You can install the newest version by repeating the instructions in this guide. Make sure you are using the latest tag available, which you can find on the [Moonbeam GitHub Release](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases) page.

!!! note
    On an as-needed basis, Moonbase Alpha might be purged and reset. In these instances, you will need to purge both the parachain data and the relay chain data. If a purge is required, node operators will be notified in advance (via our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=\_blank}).

# Run a Tracing Node

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Geth's `debug` and `txpool` APIs and OpenEthereum's `trace` module provide non-standard RPC methods for getting a deeper insight into transaction processing. As part of Moonbeam's goal of providing a seamless Ethereum experience for developers, there is support for some of these non-standard RPC methods. Supporting these RPC methods is an important milestone because many projects, such as [The Graph](https://thegraph.com){target=\_blank}, rely on them to index blockchain data.

To use the supported RPC methods, you need to run a tracing node, which is slightly different than running a full node. There is a different Docker image, called `moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam-tracing` that needs to be used for tracing. Additional flags will also need to be used to tell the node which of the non-standard features to support.

This guide will show you how to get started running a tracing node on Moonbeam with the `debug`, `txpool`, and `tracing` flags enabled.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

Similarly to running a regular node, you can spin up a tracing node using Docker or Systemd. If you choose to use Docker, you must [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/){target=\_blank} if you haven't already. At the time of writing, the Docker version used was 19.03.6.

## Tracing Node Flags {: #tracing-node-flags }

Spinning up a `debug`, `txpool`, or `tracing` node is similar to [running a full node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/){target=_blank}, but requires additional flags to enable the non-standard Ethereum RPC modules. These flags control tracing depth, caching, and runtime configuration.

- **`--ethapi debug`**: Enables the `debug` module with RPC methods such as `debug_traceTransaction`, `debug_traceBlockByNumber`, `debug_traceBlockByHash`, and `debug_traceCall`.
- **`--ethapi trace`**: Enables the `trace` module and its associated RPC methods like `trace_filter`.
- **`--ethapi txpool`**: Enables the `txpool` module, which provides `txpool_content`, `txpool_inspect`, and `txpool_status`.
- **`--wasm-runtime-overrides <path/to/overrides>`**: **Required** for tracing. Specifies the path where local Wasm runtimes are stored.  
  - For Docker setups, use `/moonbeam/<network>-substitutes-tracing`, where `<network>` is `moonbeam`, `moonriver`, or `moonbase` (for Moonbase Alpha or dev nodes).
- **`--runtime-cache-size 64`**: **Required**. Configures the number of different runtime versions preserved in the in-memory cache to `64`.
- **`--ethapi-max-permits <uint>`**: Sets the number of concurrent tracing tasks shared by tracing modules (`debug`, `trace`). Default: `10`.
- **`--ethapi-trace-max-count <uint>`**: Sets the maximum number of trace entries that a single `trace_filter` request can return. Default: `500`.
- **`--ethapi-trace-cache-duration <uint>`**: Duration (in seconds) after which cached `trace_filter` results for a block are discarded. Default: `300`.
- **`--eth-log-block-cache <bytes>`**: Size of the LRU cache (in bytes) used for storing block data. Default: `300000000`.
- **`--eth-statuses-cache <bytes>`**: Size of the LRU cache (in bytes) used for storing transaction status data. Default: `300000000`.
- **`--fee-history-limit <uint>`**: Sets the maximum fee history cache size for `eth_feeHistory` requests. Default: `2048`.
- **`--max-past-logs <uint>`**: Maximum number of logs returned by a single log query. Default: `10000`.
- **`--max-block-range <uint>`**: Maximum block span allowed in a single log query. Default: `1024`.
- **`--tracing-raw-max-memory-usage <bytes>`**: Upper bound for memory used by raw tracing requests (stack, storage, and memory data). Default: `20000000`.

!!! note
    If you want to run an RPC endpoint to connect to Polkadot.js Apps or your own dApp, use the `--unsafe-rpc-external` flag to allow external access to RPC ports. More details are available by running `moonbeam --help`.
 

## Run a Tracing Node with Docker {: #run-a-tracing-node-with-docker }

If you haven't previously run a standard full Moonbeam node, you will need to setup a directory to store chain data:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    mkdir {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    mkdir {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    mkdir {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}
    ```

Before getting started, you'll need to set the necessary permissions either for a specific or current user (replace `INSERT_DOCKER_USER` for the actual user that will run the `docker` command):

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    # chown to a specific user
    chown INSERT_DOCKER_USER {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}

    # chown to current user
    sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    # chown to a specific user
    chown INSERT_DOCKER_USER {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}

    # chown to current user
    sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    # chown to a specific user
    chown INSERT_DOCKER_USER {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}

    # chown to current user
    sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}
    ```

Instead of the standard `moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam` docker image, you will need to use `moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam-tracing` image. The latest supported version can be found on the [Docker Hub for the `moonbeam-tracing` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam-tracing/tags){target=\_blank}.

Now, execute the docker run command. Note that you have to:

 - Replace `INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME` in two different places
 - Replace `INSERT_RAM_IN_MB` for 50% of the actual RAM your server has. For example, for 32 GB RAM, the value must be set to `16000`. The minimum value is `2000`, but it is below the recommended specs

!!! note
    As of client v0.33.0, the `--ws-port` and `--ws-max-connections` flags have been deprecated and removed in favor of the `--rpc-port` and `--rpc-max-connections` flags for both RPC and WSS connections. The default port is `9944`, and the default maximum number of connections is set to 100.

The complete command for running a tracing node is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```bash
    docker run --network="host" -v "{{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}:/data" \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    {{ networks.moonbeam.tracing_tag }} \
    --base-path /data \
    --chain {{ networks.moonbeam.chain_spec }} \

    --trie-cache-size 1073741824 \
    --db-cache INSERT_RAM_IN_MB \
    --ethapi debug,trace,txpool \
    --wasm-runtime-overrides /moonbeam/moonbeam-substitutes-tracing \
    --runtime-cache-size 64 \
    -- \
    --name "INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME (Embedded Relay)"
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```bash
    docker run --network="host" -v "{{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}:/data" \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    {{ networks.moonriver.tracing_tag }} \
    --base-path /data \
    --chain {{ networks.moonriver.chain_spec }} \
    --name "INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME" \
    --state-pruning archive \
    --trie-cache-size 1073741824 \
    --db-cache INSERT_RAM_IN_MB \
    --ethapi debug,trace,txpool \
    --wasm-runtime-overrides /moonbeam/moonriver-substitutes-tracing \
    --runtime-cache-size 64 \
    -- \
    --name "INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME (Embedded Relay)"
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```bash
    docker run --network="host" -v "{{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}:/data" \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    {{ networks.moonbase.tracing_tag }} \
    --base-path /data \
    --chain {{ networks.moonbase.chain_spec }} \
    --name "INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME" \
    --state-pruning archive \
    --trie-cache-size 1073741824 \
    --db-cache INSERT_RAM_IN_MB \
    --ethapi debug,trace,txpool \
    --wasm-runtime-overrides /moonbeam/moonbase-substitutes-tracing \
    --runtime-cache-size 64 \
    -- \
    --name "INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME (Embedded Relay)"
    ```

=== "Moonbeam Dev Node"

    ```bash
    docker run --network="host" \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    {{ networks.development.tracing_tag }} \
    --name "INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME" \
    --ethapi debug,trace,txpool \
    --wasm-runtime-overrides /moonbeam/moonbase-substitutes-tracing \
    --runtime-cache-size 64 \
    --dev
    ```

You should see a terminal log similar to the following if you spun up a Moonbase Alpha tracing node:

## Run a Tracing Node with Systemd {: #run-a-tracing-node-with-systemd }

When you run a node using Systemd, you'll need to start off by setting up the Moonbeam binary. To do so you'll need to follow the instructions on the [Run a Node on Moonbeam Using Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/){target=\_blank} page. In general, you'll need to:

1. Setup the Moonbeam binary by following the [Release Binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#the-release-binary){target=\_blank} instructions. Or if you want to compile the binary yourself, you can follow the [Compile the Binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#compile-the-binary){target=\_blank} instructions
2. Follow the instructions in the [Setup the Service](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#setup-the-service){target=\_blank} instructions

Once you've finished going through the instructions in those specific sections, you can continue on to the below instructions.

### Setup the Wasm Overrides {: #setup-the-wasm-overrides }

You'll need to create a directory for the Wasm runtime overrides and obtain them from the [Moonbeam Runtime Overrides repository](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam-runtime-overrides){target=\_blank} on GitHub.

You can clone the repository to any location on your local machine. For simplicity, you can use the directory where you're storing on-chain data. To set up the Wasm override files, you can take the following steps:

1. Clone the [Moonbeam Runtime Overrides repository](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam-runtime-overrides){target=\_blank}

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam-runtime-overrides.git
    ```

2. Move the Wasm overrides into your on-chain data directory:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        mv moonbeam-runtime-overrides/wasm {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        mv moonbeam-runtime-overrides/wasm {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        mv moonbeam-runtime-overrides/wasm {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}
        ```

3. Delete the override files for the networks that you aren't running

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        rm {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/wasm/moonriver-runtime-* &&  rm {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/wasm/moonbase-runtime-*
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        rm {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/wasm/moonbeam-runtime-* &&  rm {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/wasm/moonbase-runtime-*
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        rm {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/wasm/moonbeam-runtime-* &&  rm {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/wasm/moonriver-runtime-*
        ```

4. Set user permissions for the overrides:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```bash
        chmod +x {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/wasm/*
        chown moonbeam_service {{ networks.moonbeam.node_directory }}/wasm/*
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```bash
        chmod +x {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/wasm/*
        chown moonriver_service {{ networks.moonriver.node_directory }}/wasm/*
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```bash
        chmod +x {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/wasm/*
        chown moonbase_service {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/wasm/*
        ```

### Create the Configuration File {: #create-the-configuration-file }

The next step is to create the systemd configuration file, you'll need to:

 - Replace `INSERT_YOUR_NODE_NAME` in two different places
 - Replace `INSERT_RAM_IN_MB` for 50% of the actual RAM your server has. For example, for 32 GB RAM, the value must be set to `16000`. The minimum value is `2000`, but it is below the recommended specs
 - Double-check that the binary is in the proper path as described below (_ExecStart_)
 - Double-check the base path if you've used a different directory
 - Name the file `/etc/systemd/system/moonbeam.service`

!!! note
    As of client v0.33.0, the `--ws-port` and `--ws-max-connections` flags have been deprecated and removed in favor of the `--rpc-port` and `--rpc-max-connections` flags for both RPC and WSS connections. The default port is `9944`, and the default maximum number of connections is set to 100.

!!! note
    If you want to run an RPC endpoint, to connect polkadot.js.org, or to run your own application, use the `--unsafe-rpc-external` flag to run the full node with external access to the RPC ports. More details are available by running `moonbeam --help`.

### Run the Service {: #run-the-service }

Register and start the service by running:

```bash
systemctl enable moonbeam.service
systemctl start moonbeam.service
```

And lastly, verify that the service is running:

# Moonbeam Account Balances

## Introduction {: #introduction }

While Moonbeam strives to be compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, there are some important Moonbeam differences that developers should know and understand in terms of account balances.

One of the design goals of Moonbeam is to create an environment that is as close as possible to Ethereum, and to offer a set of Web3 RPC endpoints that are compatible with Ethereum. However, Moonbeam is also a Substrate based chain, which means that it exposes Substrate RPCs, and that it has integral functionality that is powered by Substrate such as Staking, Governance, and other features which are not part of the Ethereum API.

Moonbeam [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} are one way that Moonbeam achieves Ethereum compatibility, by changing the underlying account type in the protocol to be Ethereum-like (H160 or 20 byte addresses starting with `0x`). Unified accounts are used by both the Substrate and Ethereum APIs, and map to the same underlying data storage on the blockchain. Nevertheless, there are important differences that users coming from Ethereum should understand when using Moonbeam accounts via the Ethereum API.

This guide will outline some of these main differences and what to expect when using Moonbeam for the first time.

## Ethereum Account Balances {: #ethereum-account-balances }

An account on Ethereum is an entity with a token balance (Ether or ETH in this case). Account-holders can send Ether transactions on Ethereum and accounts can be controlled by either users (with the private key for signing) or smart contracts.

Therefore, Ethereum has two main types of accounts: user-owned and contract-owned. No matter the type, an Ethereum account has a single balance field that represents the number of Wei owned by this address, where Wei is a denomination of ETH (1 x 10^18 Wei per ETH).

![Ethereum balances diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/balances/balances-1.webp)

## Moonbeam Account Balances {: #moonbeam-account-balances }

An account on Moonbeam is also an entity with a token balance (the token will depend on the network). Like on Ethereum, account holders can send token transactions on the Moonbeam Network they are connected to. In addition, accounts can be controlled by users (with the private key for signing) or smart contracts.

As with Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: user-owned and contract owned. However, on Moonbeam, within both account types, there are also [proxy accounts](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-proxies/){target=\_blank}, which can perform a limited number of actions on behalf of another account. In terms of balances, all of Moonbeam account types have five (5) different [balance types](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-accounts/#balance-types#balance-types){target=\_blank}:

 - **Free** — refers to the balance that can be used (not locked/frozen) from the Substrate API. The concept of `free` balance depends on the action to be executed. For example, voting in democracy will not subtract the allocated balance to the vote from `free` balance, but token holders won't be able to transfer that balance
 - **Reducible** — refers to the balance that can be used (not locked/frozen) through the Ethereum API on Moonbeam. For example, this is the balance displayed by MetaMask. It is the real spendable balance, accounting for all democracy locks (displayed as transferable in Polkadot.js Apps)
 - **Reserved** — refers to the balance held due to on-chain requirements, and that can be freed by performing some on-chain action.  For example, bonds for creating a proxy account or setting an on-chain identity are shown as `reserved balance`. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed
 - **Misc frozen** — represents a balance that the `free` balance may not drop below when withdrawing funds, except for transaction fee payment. For example, funds being used to vote on a governance proposal are shown as `misc frozen`. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed
 - **Fee frozen** — represents a balance that the `free` balance may not drop below when specifically paying for transaction fees. These funds are **not** transferable or accessible via the Ethereum API until they are freed

![Moonbeam balances diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/balances/balances-2.webp)

### Calculating Your Transferable Balance {: #calculating-your-transferable-balance }

An account's transferable or spendable balance can be calculated as the free balance minus the maximum of `0` or the difference between frozen and reserved tokens: 

```text
Transferable = free - max(0, frozen - reserved )
```

Here are two examples of calculating transferable balances:

An account has `1000` free tokens, `200` frozen tokens, and `50` reserved tokens. The transferable balance is calculated as:

```text
Transferable = 1000 - max(0, 200 - 50) = 1000 - 150 = 850
```

If the frozen tokens are less than the reserved tokens, with `1000` free tokens, `100` frozen tokens, and `150` reserved tokens, the transferable balance would be:

```text
Transferable = 1000 - max(0, 100 - 150) = 1000 - 0 = 1000
```

### Retrieve Your Balance {: #retrieve-your-balance }

You can check on your balances, including your free (or transferable) and reserved balances (if exists), using the [Polkadot.js API](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}.

!!! note
    To test out the examples in this guide on Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network');

const main = async () => {
  const polkadotApi = await ApiPromise.create({
    provider: wsProvider,
  });

  const balances = await polkadotApi.query.system.account('INSERT_ADDRESS');
  console.log(balances.toHuman());
};

main();
```

!!! note
    As of runtime 4000, staking locks were replaced by balance freezes due to the `ParachainStaking` pallet migration from the deprecated `Currency` trait to the modern `Fungible` trait. Queries that previously read `Balances.Locks` with identifiers [`stkngcol`, `stkngdel`] must now read `Balances.Freezes` with freeze reasons [`StakingCollator`, `StakingDelegator`].

You can retrieve your balance freezes using the Polkadot.js API as shown below.

```js
// Query Balances.Freezes
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network');

const main = async () => {
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });
  const freezes = await api.query.balances.freezes('INSERT_ADDRESS_HERE');
  console.log(freezes.toHuman());
};

main();
```


## Main Differences {: #main-differences }

The main difference between account balances on Ethereum and Moonbeam lies in the concept of locked and reserved balance on Moonbeam. These are tokens that are still owned by that account, but they are not spendable (yet).

From the Ethereum's API perspective, an account might show that it has a certain balance (called `reducible` balance). However, after an on-chain action, this value might increase (or decrease) without an actual balance transfer.

It is important to note that the account and behavior differences described here apply to account balances with the base asset (GLMR, MOVR) only and the balances of that asset that aren't interacting with smart contracts. As soon as a Moonbeam account balance is interacting with smart contracts, the behavior will be the same as Ethereum behavior. For example, if you wrap MOVR on Moonriver there is no way for the underlying balance to change via staking or governance actions, because that is part of the storage of the contract. In this case the reducible balance of that account has been committed to the wrapped MOVR smart contract and can't be modified by Substrate actions.

# Moonbeam Consensus & Finality

## Introduction {: #introduction }

While Moonbeam strives to be compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, there are some important Moonbeam differences that developers should know and understand in terms of consensus and finality.

In short, consensus is a way for different parties to agree on a shared state. As blocks are created, nodes in the network must decide which block will represent the next valid state. Finality defines when that valid state cannot be altered or reversed.

Ethereum began by using a consensus protocol based on [Proof-of-Work (PoW)](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/){target=\_blank}, which provides probabilistic finality. However, in 2022, Ethereum switched to [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/){target=\_blank}, which provides deterministic finality, and no longer uses PoW. In contrast, Moonbeam uses a hybrid consensus protocol based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), which also provides deterministic finality. DPoS is an evolution of Polkadot's [Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/){target=\_blank} concept, that puts more power into the hands of token holders by allowing delegators to choose which collator candidate they want to support and in what magnitude.

This guide will outline some of these main differences around consensus and finality, and what to expect when using Moonbeam for the first time.

## Ethereum Consensus and Finality {: #ethereum-consensus-and-finality }

Ethereum currently uses a PoS consensus protocol, in which validators stake ETH in the network and are responsible for producing blocks and checking the validity of new blocks. The timing of block production is fixed and is divided into 12 second slots and 32 slot epochs. One validator per slot is randomly selected to produce a block and broadcast it to the network. There is a randomly selected committee of validators per slot that is responsible for determining the validity of the block. The greater the stake in the network, the greater the chance the validator will be chosen to produce or validate a block.

Finality is deterministic in Ethereum's PoS consensus protocol and is achieved through "checkpoint" blocks. Validators agree on the state of a block at particular checkpoint blocks, which are always the first block in an epoch, and if two-thirds of the validators agree, the block is finalized. Block finality can be reverted; however, there are strong economic incentives in place so validators do not attempt to collude to revert a block. You can find out more information in Vitalik's [On Settlement Finality](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/05/09/on-settlement-finality){target=\_blank} blog, under the Finality in Casper section.

## Moonbeam Consensus and Finality {: #moonbeam-consensus-and-finality }

In Polkadot, there are collators and validators. [Collators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-collator/){target=\_blank} maintain parachains (in this case, Moonbeam) by collecting transactions from users and producing state transition proofs for the relay chain [validators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-validator/){target=\_blank}. The collator set (nodes that produce blocks) is selected based on the stake they have in the network.

For finality, Polkadot and Kusama rely on [GRANDPA](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#finality-gadget-grandpa){target=\_blank}. GRANDPA provides deterministic finality for any given transaction (block). In other words, when a block or transaction is marked as final, it can't be reverted except via on-chain governance or forking. Moonbeam follows this deterministic finality.

## Main Differences Between PoS and DPoS {: #main-differences }

In terms of consensus, Moonbeam is based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake, while Ethereum relies on a standard Proof-of-Stake system, which is slightly different. Although both mechanisms rely on the use of stake to validate and create new blocks, there are some key differences.

With PoS on Ethereum, validators are selected to produce and validate blocks based on their own stake in the network. As long as a validator has placed a validator deposit, they can be selected to produce and validate blocks. However, as previously mentioned, the greater the stake in the network, the higher the chances a validator has to be selected to produce and validate blocks.

On the other hand, with DPoS on Moonbeam, collators become eligible to produce blocks based on their own stake plus their delegated stake in the network. Any token holder can choose to delegate their stake to a collator candidate. The top collator candidates by stake, including delegations, join the active set. The number of candidates in the active set is subject to [governance](/learn/features/governance/){target=\_blank}. Once in the active set, collators are randomly selected to produce blocks using the Nimbus Consensus Framework. It is important to note that once a collator is in the active set, their total stake does not impact their chances of being selected to produce blocks.

In terms of finality, blocks on Ethereum can take quite a bit longer to finalize than on Moonbeam due to the checkpoint finality system it uses. In Ethereum, validators determine finality at checkpoint blocks, which are always the first block in an epoch. Since an epoch has 32 slots and each slot is 12 seconds, it'll take at least 384 seconds, or 6.4 minutes for a block to be finalized.

Moonbeam does not use checkpoint blocks and instead relies on Polkadot's GRANDPA finality gadget, where the finality process is completed in parallel to block production. In addition, the finality process incorporates the blockchain's structure, which allows the relay chain validators to vote on the highest block that they think is valid. In this scenario, the vote would apply to all of the blocks leading up to the one that is finalized, which speeds up the finalization process. After a block has been included in the relay chain, a block can be finalized within one block on Moonbeam.

## Check Transaction Finality with Ethereum RPC Endpoints {: #check-tx-finality-with-ethereum-rpc-endpoints }

Although the finality gadgets differ, you can use the same, fairly simple strategy to check for transaction finality on both Ethereum and Moonbeam:

 1. You ask the network for the hash of the latest finalized block
 2. You retrieve the block number using the hash
 3. You compare it with the block number of your transaction. If your transaction was included in a previous block, it is finalized
 4. As a safety check, retrieve the block by number and verify that the given transaction hash is in the block

The snippets below follow this strategy to check transaction finality. It uses the `finalized` option for the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block){target=\_blank} to get the latest finalized block.

To test out the examples in this guide on Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.

## Check Transaction Finality with Moonbeam RPC Endpoints {: #check-tx-finality-with-moonbeam-rpc-endpoints }

Moonbeam has added support for two custom RPC endpoints, `moon_isBlockFinalized` and `moon_isTxFinalized`, that can be used to check whether an on-chain event is finalized. These methods are a bit more straightforward, as you don't need to compare block numbers to ensure your transaction is finalized.

For more information, you can go to the [Finality RPC Endpoints](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/moonbeam-custom-api/#rpc-methods){target=\_blank} section of the Moonbeam Custom API page.

You can modify the scripts from the Ethereum RPC section above to use `moon_isBlockFinalized` and `moon_isTxFinalized`. To do this, you can make custom calls to the Substrate JSON-RPC using the `send` method of both [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io){target=\_blank} and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6){target=\_blank}. Custom RPC requests are also possible using [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io){target=\_blank} with the `make_request` method. You'll need to pass in the method name and the parameters to the custom request, which you can find on the [Moonbeam Custom API](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/moonbeam-custom-api/){target=\_blank} page.

## Check Transaction Finality with Substrate RPC Endpoints {: #check-tx-finality-with-substrate-rpc-endpoints }

Using the following three RPC requests from the Substrate JSON-RPC, you can fetch the current finalized block and compare it with the block number of the transaction you want to check finality for:

- `chain_getFinalizedHead` - the first request gets the block hash of the last finalized block
- `chain_getHeader` - the second request gets the block header for a given block hash
- `eth_getTransactionReceipt` - this retrieves the transaction receipt given the transaction hash

The [Polkadot.js API package](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank} and [Python Substrate Interface package](/builders/substrate/libraries/py-substrate-interface/){target=\_blank} provide developers with a way to interact with Substrate chains using JavaScript and Python.

You can find more information about Polkadot.js and the Substrate JSON-RPC in the [official Polkadot.js documentation site](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc){target=\_blank}, and more about Python Substrate Interface in the [official PySubstrate documentation site](https://jamdottech.github.io/py-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank}.

# Security Considerations

## Introduction {: #introduction }

When developing smart contracts on Moonbeam, there are some security considerations to be aware of that do not apply when developing on Ethereum. Moonbeam has several [precompiled contracts](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/){target=\_blank}, which are Solidity interfaces that enable developers to access Substrate-based functionality through the Ethereum API, but circumventing the EVM. Although the precompiled contracts are designed to improve the developer experience, there can be some unintended consequences that must be considered.

This guide will outline and provide examples of some security considerations to be cognizant of when developing on Moonbeam.

## Arbitrary Code Execution {: #arbitrary-code-execution }

Arbitrary code execution in Solidity is the ability to execute code and call functions of other contracts using an arbitrary number of arguments of any type.

A smart contract allows arbitrary execution of another contract when it allows a user to influence its own `call()` and pass in arbitrary call data and/or the `call()`s target. The [`call()` function](https://solidity-by-example.org/call){target=\_blank} is made available through the [address data type in Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#address){target=\_blank}. When the `call()` function is invoked, the target contract is called using the arbitrary call data.

Arbitrary code execution follows the pattern in the diagram below when **Contract A** allows a user to influence its call to **Contract B**.

![Arbitrary code execution](/images/learn/core-concepts/security/security-1.webp)

As previously mentioned, one major concern of arbitrarily executing code on Moonbeam is that Moonbeam has precompile contracts that can be called, which can be used to get around some protections that are typically available on Ethereum. To safely use arbitrary code execution on Moonbeam, you should consider the following, which **only applies to contracts that allow arbitrary code execution**:

- Moonbeam [precompiled contracts](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/){target=\_blank} such as the Native ERC-20 precompile, XC-20 precompiles, and XCM-related precompiles allow users to manage and transfer assets without requiring access to the EVM. Instead, these actions are done using native Substrate code. So, if your contract holds native tokens or XC-20s and allows arbitrary code execution, these precompiles can be used to drain the balance of the contract, bypassing any security checks that are normally enforced by the EVM
- Setting the value attribute of the transaction object to a fixed amount when using the `call()` function (for example, `call{value: 0}(...)`) can be bypassed by calling the native asset precompile and specifying an amount to transfer in the encoded call data
- Allowing users that consume your contract to pass in arbitrary call data that will execute any function on the target contract, especially if the contract being targeted is a precompile, is **not** safe. To be safe, you can hard code the function selector for a safe function that you want to allow to be executed
- Blacklisting target contracts (including precompiles) in the function that executes arbitrary call data is **not** considered safe, as other precompiles might be added in the future. Providing whitelisted target contracts in the function that executes the arbitrary call data is considered safe, assuming that the contracts being called are not precompiles, or that in the case they are, the contract making the call does not hold the native token or any XC-20

In the following sections, you'll learn about each of these security considerations through examples.

### Precompiles Can Override a Set Value {: #setting-a-value }

On Ethereum, a smart contract that allows for arbitrary code execution could force the value of a call to be a specific amount (for example, `{value: 0}`), guaranteeing that only that amount of native currency would be sent with the transaction. Whereas on Moonbeam, the [native ERC-20 precompile contract](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/erc20/){target=\_blank} enables you to interact with the native currency on Moonbeam as an ERC-20 through the Substrate API. As a result, you can transfer the Moonbeam native asset from a smart contract by setting the `value` of a call, as well as through the native ERC-20 precompile. If you set the `value` of an arbitrary call, it can be overridden by targeting the [native ERC-20 precompile contract](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/erc20/){target=\_blank} and passing in call data to transfer the native asset. Since ERC-20s and XC-20s are not native assets, setting the value attribute doesn't provide any protection for these types of assets on Ethereum or Moonbeam.

For example, if you have a contract that allows arbitrary code execution and you pass it encoded call data that transfers the balance of a contract to another address, you could essentially drain the given contract of its balance.

To get the encoded call data, you can use any of the [ABI encoding functions outlined in the Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions){target=\_blank}, including `abi.encodeWithSelector` as seen in the following function:

```solidity
function getBytes(address _erc20Contract, address _arbitraryCallContract, address _to) public view returns (bytes memory) {
    // Load ERC-20 interface of contract
    IERC20 erc20 = IERC20(_erc20Contract);
    // Get amount to transfer
    uint256 amount = erc20.balanceOf(_arbitraryCallContract);
    // Build the encoded call data
    return abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, _to, amount);
}
```

Once you have the encoded call data, you could make an arbitrary call to the [native ERC-20 precompile contract](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/erc20/){target=\_blank}, set the value of the call to `0`, and pass in the call data in bytes:

```solidity
function makeArbitraryCall(address _target, bytes calldata _bytes) public {
    // Value: 0 does not protect against native ERC-20 precompile calls or XCM precompiles
    (bool success,) = _target.call{value: 0}(_bytes);
    require(success);
}
```

The value of `0` will be overridden by the amount to be transferred as specified in the encoded call data, which in this example is the balance of the contract.

### Whitelisting Safe Function Selectors {: #whitelisting-function-selectors }

By whitelisting a specific function selector, you can control what functions can be executed and ensure only functions that are considered safe and do not call precompiles are allowed to be called.

To get the function selector to whitelist, you can [keccack256 hash](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html){target=\_blank} the signature of the function.

Once you have the whitelisted function selector, you can use inline assembly to get the function selector from the encoded call data and compare the two selectors using the [require function](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require){target=\_blank}. If the function selector from the encoded call data matches the whitelisted function selector, you can make the call. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

```solidity
function makeArbitraryCall(address _target, bytes calldata _bytes) public {
    // Get the function selector from the encoded call data
    bytes4 selector;
    assembly {
        selector := calldataload(_bytes.offset)
    }

    // Ensure the call data calls an approved and safe function
    require(selector == INSERT_WHITELISTED_FUNCTION_SELECTOR);

    // Arbitrary call
    (bool success,) = _target.call(_bytes);
    require(success);
}
```

### Whitelisting Safe Contracts {: #whitelisting-safe-contracts}

By whitelisting a specific target contract address in the function that can execute arbitrary call data, you can ensure that the call is considered safe, as the EVM will enforce that only whitelisted contracts can be called. This assumes that the contracts being called are not precompiles. If they are precompiles, you'll want to make sure that the contract making the call does not hold the native token or any XC-20.

Blacklisting contracts from arbitrary code execution is not considered safe, as other precompiles might be added in the future.

To whitelist a given contract, you can use the [require function](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require){target=\_blank}, which will compare the target contract address to the whitelisted contract address. If the addresses match, the call can be executed. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

```solidity
function makeArbitraryCall(address _target, bytes calldata _bytes) public {
    // Ensure the contract address is safe
    require(_target == INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);

    // Arbitrary call
    (bool success,) = _target.call(_bytes);
    require(success);
}
```

## Precompiles Can Bypass Sender vs Origin Checks {: #bypass-sender-origin-checks }

The transaction origin, or `tx.origin`, is the address of the externally owned account (EOA) the transaction originated from. Whereas the `msg.sender` is the address that has initiated the current call. The `msg.sender` can be an EOA or a contract. The two can be different values if one contract calls another contract, as opposed to directly calling a contract from an EOA. In this case, the `msg.sender` will be the calling contract and the `tx.origin` will be the EOA that initially called the calling contract.

For example, if Alice calls a function in contract A that then calls a function in contract B, when looking at the call to contract B, the `tx.origin` is Alice and the `msg.sender` is contract A.

!!! note
    As a [best practice](https://consensysdiligence.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/tx-origin/){target=\_blank}, `tx.origin` should not be used for authorization. Instead, you should use `msg.sender`.

You can use the [require function](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require){target=\_blank} to compare the `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`. If they are the same address, you're ensuring that only EOAs can call the function. If the `msg.sender` is a contract address, an exception will be thrown.

```solidity
function transferFunds(address payable _target) payable public {
    require(tx.origin == msg.sender);
    _target.call{value: msg.value};
}
```

On Ethereum, you can use this check to ensure that a given contract function can only be called once by an EOA. This is because on Ethereum, EOAs can only interact with a contract once per transaction. However, **this is not the case** on Moonbeam, as EOAs can interact with a contract multiple times at once by using precompiled contracts, such as the [batch](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/batch/){target=\_blank} and [call permit](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/ux/call-permit/){target=\_blank} precompiles.

With the batch precompile, users can perform multiple calls to a contract atomically. The caller of the batch function will be the `msg.sender` and `tx.origin`, enabling multiple contract interactions at once.

With the call permit precompile, if a user wants to interact with a contract multiple times in one transaction, they can do so by signing a permit for each contract interaction and dispatching all of the permits in a single function call. This will only bypass the `tx.origin == msg.sender` check if the dispatcher is the same account as the permit signer. Otherwise, the `msg.sender` will be the permit signer and the `tx.origin` will be the dispatcher, causing an exception to be thrown.

# Balance Transfers on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

While Moonbeam strives to be compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, there are some important Moonbeam differences that developers should know and understand in terms of balance transfers of the base network token (for example, GLMR and MOVR).

Token holders have two ways of initiating a balance transfer on Moonbeam. On the one hand, users can use the Ethereum API via apps like MetaMask, MathWallet, or any other tools that use the Ethereum JSON-RPC. On the other hand, users can use the Substrate API via the Polkadot.js Apps website or directly using the Substrate RPC.

Developers need to be aware that token holders can leverage both APIs to transfer the base-layer network token. Note that these comments do not apply to transfers of other assets, like ERC-20 based assets in the Moonriver or Moonbeam EVMs. Transfers of these assets are only done via the Ethereum APIs since these are smart contract interactions.

This guide will outline some of the main differences between both APIs for base-layer network token balance transfers and what to expect when using Moonbeam for the first time.

## Ethereum Transfers {: #ethereum-transfers }

A simple balance transfer using the Ethereum API relies on the `eth_sendRawTransaction` JSON-RPC. This can be done directly from one account to another or via a smart contract.

There are different strategies to listen for transfers or balance changes on Ethereum, which are not covered in this documentation. But they are all focused on different strategies using the Ethereum JSON-RPC.

## Moonbeam Transfers {: #moonbeam-transfers }

As stated before, Moonbeam enables token holders to execute base-layer network token transfers via both the Ethereum and Substrate API. There are multiple scenarios to trigger token transfers on Moonbeam. Consequently, to monitor all transfers, **you should use the Polkadot.js SDK** (Substrate API).

Before going over the different scenarios, there are two different elements associated with a block:

 - **Extrinsic** — refers to state changes that originated outside of the system itself. The most common form of extrinsic is a transaction. They are ordered by execution
 - **Events** — refers to logs generated from the extrinsic. There can be multiple events per extrinsic. They are ordered by execution

The different transfer scenarios are:

 - **Substrate transfer** — it will create an extrinsic, either `balances.transferAllowDeath` or `balances.transferKeepAlive`. It will trigger **one** `balances.Transfer` event
 - **Substrate feature** — some native Substrate features can create extrinsic that would send tokens to an address. For example, [Treasury](/learn/features/treasury/){target=\_blank} can create an extrinsic such as `treasury.proposeSend`, which will trigger **one or multiple** `balances.Transfer` events
 - **Ethereum transfer** — it will create an `ethereum.transact` extrinsic with an empty input. It will trigger **one** `balances.Transfer` event
 - **Ethereum transfers via smart contracts** — it will create an `ethereum.transact` extrinsic with some data as input. It will trigger **one or multiple** `balances.Transfer` events

All the scenarios described above will effectively transfer base-layer network tokens. The easiest way to monitor them all is to rely on the `balances.Transfer` event.

## Monitor Native Token Balance Transfers {: #monitor-transfers }

The following code samples will demonstrate how to listen to both types of native token transfers, sent via the Substrate or Ethereum API, using either the [Polkadot.js API library](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/){target=\_blank} or [Substrate API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar){target=\_blank}. The following code snippets are for demo purposes only and should not be used without modification and further testing in a production environment.

### Using Polkadot.js API {: #using-polkadotjs-api }

The [Polkadot.js API package](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/){target=\_blank} provides developers a way to interact with Substrate chains using JavaScript.

The following code snippet uses [`subscribeFinalizedHeads`](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc/#subscribefinalizedheads-header){target=\_blank} to subscribe to new finalized block headers, loops through extrinsics fetched from the block, and retrieves the events of each extrinsic. Then, it checks if any event corresponds to a `balances.Transfer` event. If so, it will extract the `from`, `to`, `amount`, and the `tx hash` of the transfer and display it on the console. Note that the `amount` is shown in the smallest unit (Wei).  You can find all the available information about Polkadot.js and the Substrate JSON-RPC on their [official documentation site](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc){target=\_blank}.

```ts
import { typesBundlePre900 } from 'moonbeam-types-bundle';
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

// This script will listen to all GLMR transfers (Substrate & Ethereum) and extract the tx hash
// It can be adapted for Moonriver or Moonbase Alpha

const main = async () => {
  // Define the provider for Moonbeam
  const wsProvider = new WsProvider('wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network');
  // Create the provider using Moonbeam types
  const polkadotApi = await ApiPromise.create({
    provider: wsProvider,
    typesBundle: typesBundlePre900 as any,
  });

  // Subscribe to finalized blocks
  await polkadotApi.rpc.chain.subscribeFinalizedHeads(
    async (lastFinalizedHeader) => {
      const [{ block }, records] = await Promise.all([
        polkadotApi.rpc.chain.getBlock(lastFinalizedHeader.hash),
        polkadotApi.query.system.events.at(lastFinalizedHeader.hash),
      ]);

      block.extrinsics.forEach((extrinsic, index) => {
        const {
          method: { args, method, section },
        } = extrinsic;

        const isEthereum = section == 'ethereum' && method == 'transact';

        // Gets the transaction object
        const tx = args[0] as any;

        // Convert to the correct Ethereum Transaction format
        const ethereumTx =
          isEthereum &&
          ((tx.isLegacy && tx.asLegacy) ||
            (tx.isEip1559 && tx.asEip1559) ||
            (tx.isEip2930 && tx.asEip2930));

        // Check if the transaction is a transfer
        const isEthereumTransfer =
          ethereumTx &&
          ethereumTx.input.length === 0 &&
          ethereumTx.action.isCall;

        // Retrieve all events for this extrinsic
        const events = records.filter(
          ({ phase }) =>
            phase.isApplyExtrinsic && phase.asApplyExtrinsic.eq(index)
        );

        // This hash will only exist if the transaction was executed through Ethereum.
        let ethereumHash = '';

        if (isEthereum) {
          // Search for Ethereum execution
          events.forEach(({ event }) => {
            if (event.section == 'ethereum' && event.method == 'Executed') {
              ethereumHash = event.data[2].toString();
            }
          });
        }

        // Search if it is a transfer
        events.forEach(({ event }) => {
          if (event.section == 'balances' && event.method == 'Transfer') {
            const from = event.data[0].toString();
            const to = event.data[1].toString();
            const balance = (event.data[2] as any).toBigInt();

            const substrateHash = extrinsic.hash.toString();

            console.log(
              `Transfer from ${from} to ${to} of ${balance} (block #${lastFinalizedHeader.number})`
            );
            console.log(`  - Triggered by extrinsic: ${substrateHash}`);
            if (isEthereum) {
              console.log(
                `  - Ethereum (isTransfer: ${isEthereumTransfer}) hash: ${ethereumHash}`
              );
            }
          }
        });
      });
    }
  );
};

main();
```

### Using Substrate API Sidecar {: #using-substrate-api-sidecar }

Developers can also retrieve Moonbeam blocks and monitor transactions sent via both the Substrate and Ethereum APIs using [Substrate API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar){target=\_blank}, a REST API service for interacting with blockchains built with the Substrate framework.

The following code snippet uses the Axios HTTP client to query the [Sidecar endpoint `/blocks/head`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist){target=\_blank} for the latest finalized block and then decodes the block for the `from`, `to`, `value`, `tx hash`, and `transaction status` of native token transfers at both the EVM and Substrate API level.

```js
import axios from 'axios';

// This script will decode all native token transfers (Substrate & Ethereum) in a given Sidecar block, and extract the tx hash. It can be adapted for any Moonbeam network.

// Endpoint to retrieve the latest block
const endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/blocks/head';

async function main() {
  try {
    // Retrieve the block from the Sidecar endpoint
    const response = await axios.get(endpoint);
    // Retrieve the block height of the current block
    console.log('Block Height: ' + response.data.number);

    // Iterate through all extrinsics in the block
    response.data.extrinsics.forEach((extrinsic) => {
      // Retrieve Ethereum Transfers
      if (
        extrinsic.method.pallet === 'ethereum' &&
        extrinsic.method.method === 'transact'
      ) {
        // Get the value for any of the three EIP transaction standards supported
        const value =
          (extrinsic.args.transaction.legacy &&
            extrinsic.args.transaction.legacy.value) ||
          (extrinsic.args.transaction.eip1559 &&
            extrinsic.args.transaction.eip1559.value) ||
          (extrinsic.args.transaction.eip2930 &&
            extrinsic.args.transaction.eip2930.value);

        // Iterate through the events to get transaction details
        extrinsic.events.forEach((event) => {
          if (
            event.method.pallet === 'ethereum' &&
            event.method.method === 'Executed'
          ) {
            console.log('From: ' + event.data[0]);
            console.log('To: ' + event.data[1]);
            console.log('Tx Hash: ' + event.data[2]);
            console.log('Value: ' + value);
            // Check the execution status
            if (event.data[3].succeed) {
              console.log('Status: Success');
            } else {
              console.log('Status: Failed');
            }
          }
        });
      }

      // Retrieve Substrate Transfers
      if (
        extrinsic.method.pallet === 'balances' &&
        (extrinsic.method.method === 'transferKeepAlive' ||
          extrinsic.method.method === 'transferAllowDeath')
      ) {
        // Iterate through the events to get transaction details
        extrinsic.events.forEach((event) => {
          if (
            event.method.pallet === 'balances' &&
            event.method.method === 'Transfer'
          ) {
            console.log('From: ' + event.data[0]);
            console.log('To: ' + event.data[1]);
            console.log('Tx Hash: ' + extrinsic.hash);
            console.log('Value: ' + event.data[2]);
            // Check the execution status
            if (extrinsic.success) {
              console.log('Status: Success');
            } else {
              console.log('Status: Failed');
            }
          }
        });
      }
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

main();
```

# Calculating Transaction Fees on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Similar to [the Ethereum and Substrate APIs for sending transfers](/learn/core-concepts/transfers-api/){target=\_blank} on Moonbeam, the Substrate and EVM layers on Moonbeam also have distinct transaction fee models that developers should be aware of when they need to calculate and keep track of transaction fees for their transactions.

For starters, Ethereum transactions consume gas units based on their computational complexity and data storage requirements. On the other hand, Substrate transactions use the concept of "weight" to determine fees. In this guide, you'll learn how to calculate the transaction fees for both Substrate and Ethereum transactions. In terms of Ethereum transactions, you'll also learn about the key differences between how transaction fees are calculated on Moonbeam and Ethereum.

### Key Differences with Ethereum {: #key-differences-with-ethereum}

There are some key differences between the transaction fee model on Moonbeam and the one on Ethereum that developers should be mindful of when developing on Moonbeam:

  - The [dynamic fee mechanism](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-dynamic-fee-mechanism-for-moonbeam-and-moonriver/241){target=\_blank} resembles that of [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank} but the implementation is different

  - The amount of gas used in Moonbeam's transaction fee model is mapped from the transaction's Substrate extrinsic `refTime` component of the transaction weight via a fixed factor of `{{ networks.moonbase.tx_weight_to_gas_ratio }}` and `proofSize` component of the transaction weight via a fixed factor of `{{ xcm.generic_weights.proof_size.weight_per_gas }}`. The transaction weight vector is then multiplied with the unit gas price to calculate the transaction fee. This fee model means it can potentially be significantly cheaper to send transactions such as basic balance transfers via the Ethereum API than the Substrate API.

  - The EVM is designed to solely have capacity for gas and Moonbeam requires additional metrics outside of gas. In particular, Moonbeam needs the ability to record proof size, which is the amount of storage required on Moonbeam for a relay chain validator to verify a state transition. When the capacity limit for proof size has been reached for the current block, which is 25% of the block limit, an "Out of Gas" error will be thrown. This can happen even if there is remaining *legacy* gas in the gasometer. This additional metric also impacts refunds. Refunds are based on the more consumed resource after the execution. In other words, if more proof size has been consumed proportionally than legacy gas, the refund will be calculated using proof size

  - Moonbeam has implemented a new mechanism defined in [MBIP-5](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/master/MBIPS/MBIP-5.md){target=\_blank} that limits block storage and increases gas usage for transactions that result in an increase in storage

## Overview of MBIP-5 {: #overview-of-mbip-5 }

MBIP-5 introduced changes to Moonbeam's fee mechanism that account for storage growth on the network, which deviates from the way Ethereum handles fees. By raising the gas needed to execute transactions that increase chain state and by establishing a block storage limit, it controls storage growth.

This impacts contract deployments that add to the chain state, transactions that create new storage entries, and precompiled contract calls that result in the creation of new accounts.

The block storage limit prevents transactions in a single block from collectively increasing the storage state by more than the limit. The limit for each network is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }}KB
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }}KB
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }}KB
    ```

To determine the amount of gas for storage in bytes, there is a ratio that is defined as:

```text
Ratio = Block Gas Limit / (Block Storage Limit * 1024 Bytes)
```

The block gas limit for each network is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbeam.gas_block }}
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonriver.gas_block }}
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    {{ networks.moonbase.gas_block }}
    ```

Knowing the block gas and storage limits, the ratio of gas to storage is computed as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonbeam.gas_block_numbers_only }} / ({{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }} * 1024)
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }} 
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonriver.gas_block_numbers_only }} / ({{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }} * 1024)
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }} 
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonbase.gas_block_numbers_only }} / ({{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.block_storage_limit }} * 1024)
    Ratio = {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }} 
    ```

Then, you can take the storage growth in bytes for a given transaction and multiply it by the gas-to-storage growth ratio to determine how many units of gas to add to the transaction. For example, if you execute a transaction that increases the storage by {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.example_storage }} bytes, the following calculation is used to determine the units of gas to add:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.example_storage }} * {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }}
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonbeam.mbip_5.example_addtl_gas }}
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.example_storage }} * {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }}
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonriver.mbip_5.example_addtl_gas }}
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.example_storage }} * {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.gas_storage_ratio }}
    Additional Gas = {{ networks.moonbase.mbip_5.example_addtl_gas }}
    ```

To see how this MBIP differentiates Moonbeam from Ethereum firsthand, you can estimate the gas for two different contract interactions on both networks: one that modifies an item in the chain state and one that doesn't. For example, you can use a greeting contract that allows you to store a name and then use the name to say "Hello".

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

contract SayHello {
    mapping(address => string) public addressToName;

    constructor(string memory _name) {
        addressToName[msg.sender] = _name;
    }

    // Store a name associated to the address of the sender
    function setName(string memory _name) public {
        addressToName[msg.sender] = _name;
    } 

    // Use the name in storage associated to the sender
    function sayHello() external view returns (string memory) {
        return string(abi.encodePacked("Hello ", addressToName[msg.sender]));
    }
}
```

You can deploy this contract on both Moonriver and Ethereum, or on Moonbeam's TestNet, Moonbase Alpha, and Ethereum's TestNet, Sepolia. The above contract has already been deployed to Moonbase Alpha and Sepolia. You can feel free to access these contracts at the following addresses:

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    0xDFF8E772A9B212dc4FbA19fa650B440C5c7fd7fd
    ```

=== "Sepolia"

    ```text
    0x8D0C059d191011E90b963156569A8299d7fE777d
    ```

Next, you can use the `eth_estimateGas` method to check the gas estimate for calling the `setName` and `sayHello` functions on each network. To do so, you'll need the bytecode for each transaction, which includes the function selector, and for the `setName` function, the name to be set. This example bytecode sets the name to "Chloe":

=== "Set Name"

    ```text
    0xc47f00270000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000543686c6f65000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    ```

=== "Say Hello"

    ```text
    0xef5fb05b
    ```

Now, you can use the following curl commands on Moonbase Alpha to return the gas estimate:

=== "Set Name"

    ```sh
    curl {{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }} -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
    '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "eth_estimateGas",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0xDFF8E772A9B212dc4FbA19fa650B440C5c7fd7fd",
            "data": "0xc47f00270000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000543686c6f65000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        }]
    }'
    ```

=== "Say Hello"

    ```sh
    curl {{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }} -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
    '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "eth_estimateGas",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0xDFF8E772A9B212dc4FbA19fa650B440C5c7fd7fd",
            "data": "0xef5fb05b"
        }]
    }'
    ```

Then on Sepolia, you can use the same bytecode for the `data` and modify the RPC URL and contract address to target the contract deployed to Sepolia:

=== "Set Name"

    ```sh
    curl https://sepolia.publicgoods.network -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
    '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "eth_estimateGas",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0x8D0C059d191011E90b963156569A8299d7fE777d",
            "data": "0xc47f00270000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000543686c6f65000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        }]
    }'
    ```

=== "Say Hello"

    ```sh
    curl https://sepolia.publicgoods.network -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
    '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "eth_estimateGas",
        "params":[{
            "to": "0x8D0C059d191011E90b963156569A8299d7fE777d",
            "data": "0xef5fb05b"
        }]
    }'
    ```

At the time of writing, the gas estimates for both networks are as follows:

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    |   Method   | Gas Estimate |
    |:----------:|:------------:|
    |  `setName` |     45977    |
    | `sayHello` |     25938    |

=== "Sepolia"

    |   Method   | Gas Estimate |
    |:----------:|:------------:|
    |  `setName` |     21520    |
    | `sayHello` |     21064    |

You'll see that on Sepolia, the gas estimates for both calls are very similar, whereas on Moonbase Alpha, there is a noticeable difference between the calls and that the `setName` call, which modifies the storage, uses more gas than the `sayHello` call.

## Ethereum API Transaction Fees {: #ethereum-api-transaction-fees }

To calculate the fee incurred on a Moonbeam transaction sent via the Ethereum API, the following formula can be used:

=== "EIP-1559"

    ```text
    GasPrice = BaseFee + MaxPriorityFeePerGas < MaxFeePerGas ? 
                BaseFee + MaxPriorityFeePerGas : 
                MaxFeePerGas;
    Transaction Fee = (GasPrice * TransactionWeight) / {{ networks.moonbase.tx_weight_to_gas_ratio }}
    ```

=== "Legacy"

    ```text
    Transaction Fee = (GasPrice * TransactionWeight) / {{ networks.moonbase.tx_weight_to_gas_ratio }}
    ```

=== "EIP-2930"

    ```text
    Transaction Fee = (GasPrice * TransactionWeight) / {{ networks.moonbase.tx_weight_to_gas_ratio }}
    ```

!!! note
    EIP-1559 transaction fees on Moonbeam are calculated using the previous block's base fee.

The following sections describe in more detail each of the components needed to calculate the transaction fee.

### Base Fee {: #base-fee}

The `BaseFee` is the minimum amount charged to send a transaction and is a value set by the network itself. It was introduced in [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank}. Moonbeam has its own [dynamic fee mechanism](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-dynamic-fee-mechanism-for-moonbeam-and-moonriver/241){target=\_blank} for calculating the base fee, which is adjusted based on block congestion. As of runtime 2300, the dynamic fee mechanism has been rolled out to all of the Moonbeam-based networks.

The minimum gas price for each network is as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"

    |     Variable      |                   Value                    |
    |:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
    | Minimum Gas Price | {{ networks.moonbeam.min_gas_price }} Gwei |

=== "Moonriver"

    |     Variable      |                   Value                    |
    |:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
    | Minimum Gas Price | {{ networks.moonriver.min_gas_price }} Gwei |

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    |     Variable      |                   Value                    |
    |:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
    | Minimum Gas Price | {{ networks.moonbase.min_gas_price }} Gwei |

To calculate the dynamic base fee, the following calculation is used:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```text
    BaseFee = NextFeeMultiplier * 31250000000 / 10^18
    ```

=== "Moonriver"

    ```text
    BaseFee = NextFeeMultiplier * 312500000 / 10^18
    ```

=== "Moonbase Alpha"

    ```text
    BaseFee = NextFeeMultiplier * 31250000 / 10^18
    ```

The value of `NextFeeMultiplier` can be retrieved from the Substrate Sidecar API, via the following endpoint:

```text
GET /pallets/transaction-payment/storage/nextFeeMultiplier?at={blockId}
```

The pallets endpoints for Sidecar returns data relevant to a pallet, such as data in a pallet's storage. You can read more about the pallets endpoint in the [official Sidecar documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist/#operations-tag-pallets){target=\_blank}. The data at hand that's required from storage is the `nextFeeMultiplier`, which can be found in the `transaction-payment` pallet. The stored `nextFeeMultiplier` value can be read directly from the Sidecar storage schema. Read as a JSON object, the relevant nesting structure is as follows:

```text
RESPONSE JSON Storage Object:
    |--at
        |--hash
        |--height
    |--pallet
    |--palletIndex
    |--storageItem
    |--keys
    |--value
```

The relevant data will be stored in the `value` key of the JSON object. This value is a fixed point data type, hence the real value is found by dividing the `value` by `10^18`. This is why [the calculation of `BaseFee`](#ethereum-api-transaction-fees) includes such an operation.

### GasPrice, MaxFeePerGas, and MaxPriorityFeePerGas {: #gasprice-maxfeepergas-maxpriorityfeepergas }

The `GasPrice` is used to specify the gas price of legacy transactions prior to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank}. The `MaxFeePerGas` and `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` were both introduced in EIP-1559 alongside the `BaseFee`. The `MaxFeePerGas` defines the maximum fee permitted to be paid per unit of gas and is the sum of the `BaseFee` and the `MaxPriorityFeePerGas`. The `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` is the maximum priority fee configured by the sender of a transaction that is used to incentivize the prioritization of a transaction in a block.

Although Moonbeam is Ethereum-compatible, it is also a Substrate-based chain at its core, and priorities work differently in Substrate than in Ethereum. In Substrate, transactions are not prioritized by gas price. To address this, Moonbeam uses a modified prioritization system that reprioritizes Substrate transactions using an Ethereum-first solution. A Substrate transaction still goes through the validity process, where it is assigned transaction tags, longevity, and a priority. The original priority is then overwritten with a new priority based on the transaction's fee per gas, which is derived from the transaction's tip and weight. If the transaction is an Ethereum transaction, the priority is set according to the priority fee.

It's important to note that priority is not the sole component responsible for determining the order of transactions in a block. Other components, such as the longevity of a transaction, also play a role in the sorting process.

The values of `GasPrice`, `MaxFeePerGas` and `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` for the applicable transaction types can be read from the block JSON object according to the structure described in [the Sidecar API page](/builders/substrate/libraries/sidecar/#evm-fields-mapping-in-block-json-object){target=\_blank}.

The data for an Ethereum transaction in a particular block can be extracted from the following block endpoint:

```text
GET /blocks/{blockId}
```

The paths to the relevant values have also been truncated and reproduced below:

=== "EIP1559"
    |      EVM Field       |                               Block JSON Field                               |
    |:--------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |     MaxFeePerGas     |     `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].args.transaction.eip1559.maxFeePerGas`     |
    | MaxPriorityFeePerGas | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].args.transaction.eip1559.maxPriorityFeePerGas` |

=== "Legacy"
    | EVM Field |                        Block JSON Field                         |
    |:---------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
    | GasPrice  | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].args.transaction.legacy.gasPrice` |

=== "EIP2930"
    | EVM Field |                         Block JSON Field                         |
    |:---------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
    | GasPrice  | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].args.transaction.eip2930.gasPrice` |

### Transaction Weight {: #transaction-weight}

`TransactionWeight` is a Substrate mechanism used to measure the execution time a given transaction takes to be executed within a block. A transaction's weight is a vector of two components: `refTime` and `proofSize`. `refTime` refers to the amount of computational time that can be used for execution. `proofSize` refers to the size of the PoV (Proof of Validity) of the Moonbeam block that gets submitted to the Polkadot Relay Chain for validation. Since both `refTime` and `proofSize` are integral components of determining a weight, it is impossible to obtain an accurate weight value with just one of these values.

For all transactions types, `TransactionWeight` can be retrieved under the event of the relevant extrinsic where the `method` field is set to:

```text
pallet: "system", method: "ExtrinsicSuccess" 
```

And then `TransactionWeight` is mapped to the following two fields of the block JSON object. `proofSize` is mapped as follows:

```text
extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[0].weight.proof_size 
```

And `refTime` is mapped as follows:

```text
extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[0].weight.ref_time 
```

### Fee History Endpoint {: #eth-feehistory-endpoint }

Moonbeam networks implement the [`eth_feeHistory`](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/ethereum/ethereum-api-endpoints/eth-fee-history){target_blank} JSON-RPC endpoint as a part of the support for EIP-1559.

`eth_feeHistory` returns a collection of historical gas information from which you can reference and calculate what to set for the `MaxFeePerGas` and `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` fields when submitting EIP-1559 transactions.

The following curl example will return the gas information of the last 10 blocks starting from the latest block on the respective Moonbeam network using `eth_feeHistory`:

=== "Moonbeam"

    ```sh
    curl --location \
         --request POST '{{ networks.moonbeam.rpc_url }}' \
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         --data-raw '{
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 1,
            "method": "eth_feeHistory",
            "params": ["0xa", "latest"]
         }'
    ```
=== "Moonriver"

    ```sh
    curl --location \
         --request POST '{{ networks.moonriver.rpc_url }}' \
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         --data-raw '{
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 1,

            "params": ["0xa", "latest"]
         }'
    ```

    ```sh
    curl --location \
         --request POST '{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}' \
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         --data-raw '{
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 1,
            "method": "eth_feeHistory",
            "params": ["0xa", "latest"]
         }'
    ```
=== "Moonbeam Dev Node"

    ```sh
    curl --location \
         --request POST '{{ networks.development.rpc_url }}' \
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         --data-raw '{
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 1,
            "method": "eth_feeHistory",
            "params": ["0xa", "latest"]
         }'
    ```

### Sample Code for Calculating Transaction Fees {: #sample-code }

The following code snippet uses the [Axios HTTP client](https://axios-http.com){target=\_blank} to query the [Sidecar endpoint `/blocks/head`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist/#operations-tag-blocks){target=\_blank} for the latest finalized block. It then calculates the transaction fees of all transactions in the block according to the transaction type (for Ethereum API: legacy, EIP-1559 or EIP-2930 standards, and for Substrate API), as well as calculating the total transaction fees in the block.

!!! note
    EIP-1559 transaction fees on Moonbeam are calculated using the previous block's base fee.

The following code sample is for demo purposes only and should not be used without modification and further testing in a production environment.

You can use the following snippet for any Moonbeam-based network, but you'll need to modify the `baseFee` accordingly. You can refer back to the [Base Fee](#base-fee) section to get the calculation for each network.

```js
import axios from 'axios';

// This script calculates the transaction fees of all transactions in a block
// according to the transaction type (for Ethereum API: legacy, EIP-1559 or
// EIP-2930 standards, and Substrate API) using the dynamic fee mechanism.
// It also calculates the total fees in the block

// Endpoint to retrieve the latest block
const endpointBlock = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/blocks/head';
// Endpoint to retrieve the latest nextFeeMultiplier
const endpointPallet =
  'http://127.0.0.1:8080/pallets/transaction-payment/storage/nextFeeMultiplier?at=';
// Endpoint to retrieve the node client's information
const endpointNodeVersion = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/node/version';

## Substrate API Transaction Fees {: #substrate-api-transaction-fees }

This section of the guide assumes you are interacting with Moonbeam blocks via [the Substrate API Sidecar](/builders/substrate/libraries/sidecar/){target=\_blank} service. There are other ways of interacting with Moonbeam blocks, such as using [the Polkadot.js API library](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}. The logic is identical once the blocks are retrieved.

You can reference the [Substrate API Sidecar page](/builders/substrate/libraries/sidecar/){target=\_blank} for information on installing and running your own Sidecar service instance, as well as more details on how to decode Sidecar blocks for Moonbeam transactions.

**Note that the information in this section assumes you are running version {{ networks.moonbase.substrate_api_sidecar.stable_version }} of the Substrate Sidecar REST API.**

All the information around fee data for transactions sent via the Substrate API can be extracted from the following block endpoint:

```text
GET /blocks/{blockId}
```

The block endpoints will return data relevant to one or more blocks. You can read more about the block endpoints on the [official Sidecar documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist/#operations-tag-blocks){target=\_blank}. Read as a JSON object, the relevant nesting structure is as follows:  

```text
RESPONSE JSON Block Object:
    ...
    |--number
    |--extrinsics
        |--{extrinsic_number}
            |--method
            |--signature
            |--nonce
            |--args
            |--tip           
            |--hash
            |--info
            |--era
            |--events
                |--{event_number}
                    |--method
                        |--pallet: "transactionPayment"
                        |--method: "TransactionFeePaid"
                    |--data
                        |--0
                        |--1
                        |--2
    ...

```

The object mappings are summarized as follows:

|   Tx Information   |                      Block JSON Field                       |
|:------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
| Fee paying account | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[0]` |
|  Total fees paid   | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[1]` |
|        Tip         | `extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[2]` |

The transaction fee related information can be retrieved under the event of the relevant extrinsic where the `method` field is set to:

```text
pallet: "transactionPayment", method: "TransactionFeePaid" 
```

And then the total transaction fee paid for this extrinsic is mapped to the following field of the block JSON object:

```text
extrinsics[extrinsic_number].events[event_number].data[1]
```

# Unified Accounts

## Introduction {: #introduction }

As Moonbeam is designed to be an Ethereum-compatible parachain on Polkadot, the underlying account system replaces the default Substrate-style accounts and keys with Ethereum-style accounts and keys. As a result, you can interact with your Moonbeam account using [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank} and Ethereum tools you may already be familiar with, such as [Remix](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} and [Hardhat](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/hardhat/){target=\_blank}.

You can also interact with your Moonbeam account using Polkadot.js Apps as it natively supports H160 addresses and ECDSA keys. For more information on this integration, you can check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam Using Polkadot.js Apps](/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Substrate EVM Compatible Blockchain {: #substrate-evm-compatible-blockchain }

Any parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem can offer a full EVM implementation, which provides the possibility of executing Solidity-based smart contracts with minimal to no changes. Substrate makes this integration possible - just plug the [EVM pallet](https://docs.rs/pallet-evm/2.0.1/pallet_evm){target=\_blank} into your runtime for EVM support, and the [Ethereum Pallet with Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} to have Ethereum RPC compatibility. The availability of these open-source modules that Moonbeam has developed with Parity has led multiple parachains to offer Ethereum compatibility on their chains.

But there is an important catch. With the configuration described above, a user, for example, Alice, can have an Ethereum-style address (H160 format), which is 40+2 hex-characters long, in a Substrate based chain. This address matches a private key, which can be used to sign transactions in the Ethereum side of the chain. Furthermore, the address is mapped into a storage slot inside the Substrate Balance pallet to a Substrate-style address (H256 format).

However, Alice only knows the private key of the H160 address, and not of the mapped version. Therefore, she is unable to send transactions with her H256 address and is limited only to do read-only operations through Substrate’s API. As a consequence, Alice needs another H256 address matching a different private key to be able to operate in the Substrate side of the chain, which include, among others, staking, balances, and governance.

The following diagram illustrates this configuration.

![Old account system diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/unified-accounts-1.webp)

This can creates friction and a poor user experience for Alice. First, she has to move tokens to her H160 mapped H256 address to be able to make transactions and deploy contracts through the EVM. Second, she also needs to hold a balance in her other H256 address (which she has a different private key for) to use Substrate-based features. So in short, Alice needs a minimum of two private keys to have the best of both worlds.

## Moonbeam Unified Accounts {: #moonbeam-unified-accounts }

Moonbeam’s focus is to create a fully Ethereum-compatible environment on Polkadot with the best user experience possible. This extends beyond the base Ethereum feature set, with additional features such as on-chain governance, staking, and cross-chain integrations.

With unified accounts, a user, for example, Bob, will only need a single H160 address, with its corresponding private key, to do everything we mentioned above, including both EVM and Substrate functions.

The diagram for this new configuration looks as follows.

![New account system diagram](/images/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/unified-accounts-2.webp)

That is it, Bob only holds one private key that matches one address. He does not need to move balances between 2 different accounts and is able to access all the features with a single account and private key. We have standardized this single account to conform to the Ethereum-style H160 address and ECDSA key standards.

# Ethereum Compatibility

Moonbeam bridges the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems, offering developers the familiarity of Ethereum's tooling and infrastructure while leveraging Polkadot's scalability and interoperability.

This documentation overviews Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility features and highlights its key components. It also covers some critical differences between Moonbeam and Ethereum so Ethereum developers know what to expect.

## Key Components {: #key-components }

### EVM Compatibility {: #evm }

Moonbeam incorporates a fully compatible EVM to execute smart contracts in Solidity or other EVM-compatible languages. This enables developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts on Moonbeam with minimal modifications.

### Ethereum-style Accounts {: #ethereum-style-accounts }

Moonbeam employs H160 Ethereum-style accounts and ECDSA keys, ensuring compatibility with existing Ethereum wallets and facilitating a smooth end-user experience. This is possible due to Moonbeam's unified accounts system, which modifies the underlying Substrate account system to use Ethereum accounts by default.

Learn more:

- [Moonbeam's unified accounts system](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank}

### JSON-RPC Support {: #json-rpc-support }

Moonbeam offers full JSON-RPC compatibility with Ethereum, allowing developers to interact with Moonbeam nodes using familiar Ethereum tools and libraries. This compatibility extends to methods for account management, transaction submission, smart contract deployment, and event monitoring.

In addition to standard Ethereum RPC methods, Moonbeam supports non-standard Debug and Trace modules, providing developers with enhanced debugging and tracing capabilities for smart contract execution. The Debug module allows developers to inspect internal state transitions and execution traces, enabling efficient debugging of complex smart contracts. The Trace module provides detailed transaction traces, including opcode-level execution information and gas consumption, facilitating performance analysis and optimization.

- [Subscribe to events with Ethereum JSON-RPC methods](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/pubsub/){target=\_blank}
- [Debug and trace transactions with non-standard RPC methods](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/){target=\_blank}

### Ethereum Developer Tools and Libraries {: #ethereum-dev-tools }

With the underlying support for Ethereum JSON-RPC methods, Moonbeam leverages Ethereum's rich ecosystem of developer libraries and environments. With seamless integration of popular Ethereum libraries and development environments, developers can leverage their existing knowledge and tooling to build and deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on Moonbeam.

- [Ethereum development environments](/builders/ethereum/libraries/){target=\_blank}

### Precompiled Contracts {: #precompiled-contracts }

Moonbeam provides precompiled contracts that allow Ethereum smart contracts to seamlessly access Substrate functionality. These precompiled contracts expose Substrate features such as on-chain governance, staking, and identity management to Ethereum-based DApps on Moonbeam. This integration ensures that Ethereum developers can harness the full potential of Moonbeam's features, expanding the possibilities for dApp development on Moonbeam.

In addition, developers can leverage Ethereum MainNet precompiles seamlessly within their smart contracts on Moonbeam. These precompiled contracts, widely used on the Ethereum network, offer optimized and efficient execution of common cryptographic operations and complex computations. By supporting Ethereum MainNet precompiles, Moonbeam ensures compatibility with Ethereum-based dApps while enabling developers to utilize familiar tools and libraries to build on its platform.

### Ethereum Token Standards {: #ethereum-token-standards }

Moonbeam supports Ethereum token standards, allowing developers to deploy and interact with tokens that adhere to popular standards such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. By supporting these standards, Moonbeam enables developers to deploy existing Ethereum tokens without modification.

Due to Moonbeam's native interoperability, ERC-20s can be sent cross-chain to other chains within the Polkadot ecosystem via Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM).

## Key Differences {: #key-differences }

### Consensus Mechanisms {: #consensus-mechanisms }

Moonbeam uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, where token holders in the network can delegate candidates to become block producers, known as _collators_. On the other hand, Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system in which validators are selected based on their stake in the network to produce and validate blocks.

- [Differences between PoS and DPoS](/learn/core-concepts/consensus-finality/#main-differences){target=_blank}

### Finality {: #finality }

Moonbeam and Ethereum have different finality processes. On Ethereum, there is a checkpoint system where validators determine finality at checkpoint blocks, which takes at least 6.4 minutes for a block to be finalized. Moonbeam relies on Polkadot's [GRANDPA](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#finality-gadget-grandpa){target=\_blank} finality gadget, which expedites finality by completing the process parallel to block production and allowing relay chain validators to vote on the highest block, finalizing all blocks leading up to that block.

- [Consensus and finality on Moonbeam](/learn/core-concepts/consensus-finality/){target=_blank}

### Proxy Accounts {: #proxy-accounts }

On both Moonbeam and Ethereum, accounts can be controlled by two main types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) or smart contracts. However, on Moonbeam, within both account types, there are also proxy accounts, which can perform a limited number of actions on behalf of another account.

- [How to set up a proxy account](/tokens/manage/proxy-accounts/){target=\_blank}

### Account Balances {: #account-balances }

Balances on Ethereum are fairly straightforward; if an account holds tokens, that account has a token balance. On Moonbeam, different balance types exist to support various Substrate functionality. There are five types: free, reducible, reserved, miscellaneous frozen, and fee frozen. When using Ethereum tools, accounts show the reducible balance and don't include locked or frozen balances.

Learn more:

- [Moonbeam account balances](/learn/core-concepts/balances/){target=_blank}

### Balance Transfers {: #balance-transfers }

Since Moonbeam is a Substrate-based chain, balance transfers of the native asset (GLMR, MOVR, and DEV) can occur through the Ethereum and Substrate APIs. Like Ethereum, transfers sent through the Ethereum API rely on the `eth_sendRawTransaction`. Transfers sent through the Substrate API are done using the Balances Pallet, a built-in module in the Substrate framework that provides functionality for managing accounts and balances.

Learn more:

- [Balance transfers on Moonbeam](/learn/core-concepts/transfers-api/){target=_blank}

### Transaction Fees {: #transaction-fees }

Moonbeam and Ethereum calculate transaction fees differently due to variations in their underlying architectures and consensus mechanisms. The fundamental difference in how transaction fees are calculated is that Ethereum uses a gas-based fee system, and Moonbeam uses a weight-based system that maps to the gas used. Moonbeam also implements additional metrics in the underlying gas calculations, including proof size and storage costs.

# Governance on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The goal of Moonbeam’s governance mechanism is to advance the protocol according to the desires of the community. In that shared mission, the governance process seeks to include all token holders. Any and all changes to the protocol must go through a referendum so that all token holders, weighted by stake, can have input on the decision.

Governance forums like the [Moonbeam Community Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} and [Polkassembly](https://moonbeam.polkassembly.io/opengov){target=\_blank} enable open discussion and allow proposals to be refined based on community input. Autonomous enactments and [forkless upgrades](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/maintenance/runtime-upgrades/#forkless-upgrades){target=\_blank} unite the community towards a shared mission to advance the protocol.

With the rollout of OpenGov (originally referred to as Gov2), the second phase of governance in Polkadot, several modifications have been introduced to the governance process. You can read the [OpenGov: What is Polkadot Gov2](https://moonbeam.network/news/opengov-what-is-polkadot-gov2){target=\_blank} blog post, which provides an overview of all of the changes made in OpenGov.

As of runtime 2400, all Moonbeam networks use OpenGov as their governance system.

## Principles {: #principles }

Guiding "soft" principles for engagement with Moonbeam's governance process include:

 - Being inclusive to token holders that want to engage with Moonbeam and that are affected by governance decisions
 - Favoring token holder engagement, even with views contrary to our own, versus a lack of engagement
 - A commitment to openness and transparency in the decision-making process
 - Working to keep the greater good of the network above personal gain
 - Acting at all times as a moral agent that considers the consequences of action (or inaction) from a moral standpoint
 - Being patient and generous in our interactions with other token holders, but not tolerating abusive or destructive language, actions, and behavior, and abiding by [Moonbeam’s Code of Conduct](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/code-of-conduct){target=\_blank}

These points were heavily inspired by Vlad Zamfir’s writings on governance. Refer to his articles, especially the [How to Participate in Blockchain Governance in Good Faith (and with Good Manners)](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/how-to-participate-in-blockchain-governance-in-good-faith-and-with-good-manners-bd4e16846434){target=\_blank} Medium article.

## On-Chain Governance Mechanics {: #on-chain-governance-mechanics }

The "hard" governance process for Moonbeam will be driven by an on-chain process that allows the majority of tokens on the network to determine the outcomes of key decisions around the network. These decision points come in the form of stake-weighted voting on proposed referenda.

Some of the main components of this governance model include:

 - **Referenda** — a stake-based voting scheme where each referendum is tied to a specific proposal for a change to the Moonbeam system including values for key parameters, code upgrades, or changes to the governance system itself
 - **Voting** — referenda will be voted on by token holders on a stake-weighted basis. Referenda which pass are subject to delayed enactment so that people who disagree with the direction of the decision have time to exit the network
 - **Council & Technical Committee Governance V1** — a group of community members who have special voting rights within the system. With the deprecation and removal of Governance v1, both of these committees were dissolved as of the [runtime 2800 release](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/runtime-rt2801-schedule/1616/4){target=\_blank}
 - **OpenGov Technical Committee** — a group of community members who can add certain proposals to the Whitelisted Track

For more details on how these Substrate frame pallets implement on-chain governance, you can checkout the [Walkthrough of Polkadot’s Governance](https://polkadot.com/blog/a-walkthrough-of-polkadots-governance){target=\_blank} blog post and the [Polkadot Governance Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-opengov/){target=\_blank}.

## Governance v2: OpenGov {: #opengov }

This section will cover everything you need to know about OpenGov on Moonbeam.

### General Definitions {: #general-definitions-gov2 }

- **Proposal** — an action or item, defined by the preimage hash, being proposed by a token holder and open for consideration and discussion by token holders
 - **Referendum** — a proposal that is up for token-holder voting. Each referendum is tied to a specific proposal for a change to the Moonbeam system including values for key parameters, code upgrades, or changes to the governance system itself

- **Preimage hash** — hash of the proposal to be enacted. The first step to make a proposal is to submit a preimage. The hash is just its identifier. The proposer of the preimage can be different than the user that proposes that preimage as a formal proposal
 - **Preimage deposit** — amount of tokens that the proposer needs to bond when submitting a preimage. It is calculated as the sum of a base deposit per network plus a fee per byte of the preimage being proposed

 - **Origin** - an authorization-based dispatch source for an operation, which is used to determine the Track that a referendum is posted under
 - **Track** - an Origin-specific pipeline that outlines the life cycle of proposals. Currently, there are five Tracks:

    |    Origin Track     |                                   Description                                    |                         Referendum Examples                          |
    |:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |        Root         |                                Highest privilege                                 |           Runtime upgrades, Technical Committee management           |
    |     Whitelisted     | Proposals to be whitelisted by the Technical Committee before being dispatched |                       Fast-tracked operations                        |
    |    General Admin    |                          For general on-chain decisions                          | Changes to XCM fees, Orbiter program, Staking parameters, Registrars |
    | Emergency Canceller |          For cancellation of a referendum. Decision Deposit is refunded          |                    Wrongly constructed referendum                    |
    |  Emergency Killer   |       For killing of bad/malicious referendum. Decision Deposit is slashed       |                         Malicious referendum                         |
    | Fast General Admin  |                      For faster general on-chain decisions                       |                       HRMP channel management                        |

Tracks have different criteria parameters that are proportional to their level of Origin class. For example, more dangerous and privileged referenda will have more safeguards, higher thresholds, and longer consideration periods for approval. Please refer to the [Governance Parameters](#governance-parameters-v2) section for more information.

- **Voting** — a mechanism for token holders to support (Aye), oppose (Nay), or remain neutral (Abstain) on a proposal. For Aye and Nay, the voting weight is determined by both the number of tokens locked and the lock duration (Conviction). Abstain votes do not receive additional weighting
    - **Conviction** — the time that token holders voluntarily lock their tokens when voting; the longer they are locked, the more weight their vote has
    - **Lock balance** — the number of tokens that a user commits to a vote (note, this is not the same as a user's total account balance)
    Moonbeam uses the concept of voluntary locking, which allows token holders to increase their voting power by locking tokens for a longer period of time. Specifying no Lock Period means a user's vote is valued at 10% of their lock balance. Specifying a greater Conviction increases voting power. For each increase in Conviction (vote multiplier), the Lock Periods double

- **Approval** — minimum "Aye" votes as a percentage of overall Conviction-weighted votes needed for approval
 - **Support** — the minimum portion of Aye and Abstain votes (ignoring conviction) needed as a percentage of the total active supply for a proposal to pass. Nay votes do not count toward Support

- **Lead-in Period** — the initial proposal voting and discussion period. At this stage, proposals are in an undecided state until they pass some criteria for the given Track. The criteria include:
    - **Prepare Period** — the minimum time the referendum needs to wait before it can progress to the next phase after submission
    - **Capacity** — limit for the number of referenda on a given Track that can be decided at once
    - **Decision Deposit** — the minimum deposit amount required for a referendum to progress to the decision phase after the end of the Lead-in Period. Since each Track has a defined Capacity, this deposit is larger than the submission deposit, and its goal is to mitigate spam
    
 - **Decide Period** - token holders continue to vote on the referendum. If a referendum does not pass by the end of the period, it will be rejected, and the Decision Deposit will be refunded
 - **Confirm Period** - a period of time within the Decide Period where the referendum needs to have maintained enough Approval and Support to be approved and move to the Enactment Period
 - **Enactment Period** - a specified time, which is defined at the time the proposal was created, that an approved referendum waits before it can be dispatched. There is a minimum amount of time for each Track

- **Vote Delegation** — a voter can give their voting power, including Conviction voting, to another token holder (delegate), who may be more knowledgeable and able to make specific decisions
 - **Multirole Delegation** — the ability to delegate voting power on a Track-by-Track basis, where a token holder can specify different delegates for each Track

!!! note
    As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.

#### Conviction Multiplier {: #conviction-multiplier-v2 }

The Conviction multiplier is related to the number of Enactment Periods the tokens will be locked for after the referenda is enacted (if approved). Consequently, the longer you are willing to lock your tokens, the stronger your vote will be weighted. You also have the option of not locking tokens at all, but vote weight is drastically reduced (tokens are still locked during the duration of the referendum).

If you were to vote 1000 tokens with a 6x Conviction, your weighted vote would be 6000 units. That is, 1000 locked tokens multiplied by the Conviction, which in this scenario would be 6. On the other hand, if you decided you didn't want to have your tokens locked after enactment, you could vote your 1000 tokens with a 0.1x Conviction. In this case, your weighted vote would only be 100 units.

The Conviction multiplier values for each network are:

### Roadmap of a Proposal {: #roadmap-of-a-proposal-v2 }

Before a proposal is submitted, the author of the proposal can submit their proposal idea to the designated Democracy Proposals section of the [Moonbeam Governance discussion forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/2){target=\_blank} for feedback from the community for at least five days. From there, the author can make adjustments to the proposal based on the feedback they've collected.

Once the author is ready, they can submit their proposal on-chain. To do so, first, they need to submit the preimage of the proposal. The submitter needs to bond a fee to store the preimage on-chain. The bond is returned once the submitter unnotes the preimage. Next, they can submit the actual proposal and pay the Submission Deposit, which is enough to cover the on-chain storage cost of the proposal. Then the Lead-in Period begins and the community can begin voting "Aye" or "Nay" on the proposal by locking tokens. In order for the referendum to advance and move out of the Lead-in Period to the Decide period, the following criteria must be met:

- The referendum must wait the duration of the Prepare Period, which allows for adequate time to discuss the proposal before it progresses to the next phase
- There is enough Capacity in the chosen Track
- A Decision Deposit has been made that meets the minimum requirements for the Track

If a referendum meets the above criteria, it moves to the Decide Period and takes up one of the spots in its designated Track. In the Decide Period, voting continues and the referendum has a set amount of days to reach the Approval and Support requirements needed for it to progress to the Confirm Period.

Once in the Confirm Period, a referendum must continuously meet the Approval and Support requirements for the duration of the period. If a referendum fails to meet the requirements at any point, it is returned to the Decide Period. If the referendum meets the Approval and Support requirements again, it can progress to the Confirm Period again and the Decide Period will be delayed until the end of the Confirm Period. If the Decide Period ends and not enough Approval and Support was received, the referendum will be rejected and the Decision Deposit will be returned. The proposal can be proposed again at any time.

If a referendum continuously receives enough Approval and Support during the Confirm Period, it will be approved and move to the Enactment Period. It will wait the duration of the Enactment Period before it gets dispatched.

The happy path for a proposal is shown in the following diagram:

![A happy path diagram of the proposal roadmap in OpenGov.](/images/learn/features/governance/proposal-roadmap.webp)

### Proposal Example Walkthrough

A proposal (with its preimage) is submitted for the General Admin Track on Moonriver would have the following characteristics:

 - The Approval curve starts at {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.percent0 }}% on {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.time0 }}, goes to {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.percent1 }}% on {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.time1 }}
 - The Support curve starts at {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_support.percent0 }}% on {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_support.time0 }}, goes to {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_support.percent1 }}% on {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_support.time1 }}
 - A referendum starts the Decide Period with 0% "Aye" votes (nobody voted in the Lead-in Period)
 - Token holders begin to vote and the Approval increases to a value above {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.percent1 }}% by {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.min_approval.time1 }}
 - If the Approval and Support thresholds are met for the duration of the Confirm Period ({{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.confirm_period.blocks }} blocks, approximately {{ networks.moonriver.governance.tracks.general_admin.confirm_period.time }}), the referendum is approved
 - If the Approval and Support thresholds are not met during the Decision Period, the proposal is rejected. Note that the thresholds need to be met for the duration of the Confirm Period. Consequently, if they are met but the Decision Period expires before the completion of the Confirm Period, the proposal is rejected

The Approval and Support percentages can be calculated using the following:

=== "Approval"

    ```text
    Approval = 100 * ( Total Conviction-weighted "Aye" votes / Total Conviction-weighted votes ) 
    ```

=== "Support"

    ```text
    Support = 100 * ( Total Aye + Abstain votes, ignoring conviction / Total supply )
    ```

### Proposal Cancellations {: #proposal-cancellations }

In the event that a proposal already in the voting stage is found to have an issue, it may be necessary to prevent its approval. These instances may involve malicious activity or technical issues that make the changes impossible to implement due to recent upgrades to the network.

Cancellations must be voted on by the network to be executed. Cancellation proposals are faster than a typical proposal because they must be decided before the enactment of the proposal they seek to cancel, but they follow the same process as other referenda.

There is a cancellation Origin for use against referenda that contain an unforeseen problem, called the Emergency Canceller. The Emergency Canceller Origin and the Root Origin are allowed to cancel referenda. Regardless of the Origin, if a proposal is cancelled, it gets rejected and the Decision Deposit gets refunded.

In addition, there is a Kill Origin, which is for bad referenda intending to harm the network, called Emergency Killer. The Emergency Killer Origin and the Root Origin have the ability to kill referenda. In this case, a proposal is cancelled and the Decision Deposit is slashed, meaning the deposit amount is burned regardless of the Origin.

### Rights of the OpenGov Technical Committee {: #rights-of-the-opengov-technical-committee }

On Polkadot, the Technical Committee from Governance v1 was replaced with the Fellowship, which is a "mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Kusama and/or Polkadot networks and protocol," according to [Polkadot's wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/web3-and-polkadot/#fellowship){target=\_blank}.

For Moonbeam's implementation of OpenGov, instead of the Fellowship, there is a community OpenGov Technical Committee that has very similar power to that of the Fellowship. Their power in governance resides in their ability to whitelist a proposal. OpenGov Technical Committee members may only vote to whitelist a proposal if whitelisting that proposal would protect against a security vulnerability to the network. The passing threshold of the OpenGov Technical Committee members on whether to whitelist a proposal is determined by governance. As such, the OpenGov Technical Committee has very limited power over the network. Its purpose is to provide technical review of urgent security issues that are proposed by token holders.

While still subject to governance, the idea behind the Whitelist track is that it will have different parameters to make it faster for proposals to pass. The Whitelist Track parameters, including approval, support, and voting, are determined by the Moonriver or Moonbeam token holders through governance and cannot be changed by the OpenGov Technical Committee.

The OpenGov Technical Committee is made up of members of the community who have technical knowledge and expertise in Moonbeam-based networks.

# Randomness on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Randomness is necessary for a variety of blockchain applications to create unbiased, unpredictable, and unique outcomes. However, obtaining a reliable source of randomness is a challenge. Computers are deterministic, meaning given the same input, the same output will always be produced. Therefore, random values generated by computers are referred to as pseudo-random as they appear to be statistically random, but given the same input, the output can easily be repeated.

Moonbeam utilizes verifiable random functions (VRF) to generate randomness that can be verified on-chain. A VRF is a cryptographic function that takes some input and produces random values, along with a proof of authenticity that they were generated by the submitter. The proof can be verified by anyone to ensure that the random values were generated correctly.

There are two available sources of randomness that provide random inputs based on block producers' VRF keys and past randomness results: [local VRF](#local-vrf) and [BABE epoch randomness](#babe-epoch-randomness). Local VRF is determined directly within Moonbeam using the collator of the block's VRF key and the last block's VRF output. On the other hand, [BABE](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/#block-production-babe){target=\_blank} epoch randomness is based on all the VRF produced by the relay chain validators during a complete [epoch](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/glossary/#epoch){target=\_blank}.

You can interact with and request on-chain randomness using the Randomness Precompile contract, a Solidity interface that enables smart contract developers to access the randomness functionality through the Ethereum API. For more information, please check out the [Interacting with the Randomness Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/){target=\_blank} guide.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

- **Epoch** - a time duration in the BABE protocol that is broken into smaller time slots. Slots are discrete units of time six seconds in length. On Polkadot, one epoch lasts approximately 2,400 slots or 4 hours. On Kusama, one epoch lasts approximately 600 slots or 1 hour.
- **Deposit** - an amount of funds required to request random words. There is one deposit per request. Once the request has been fulfilled, the deposit will be returned to the account that requested the randomness
- **Block expiration delay** - the number of blocks that must pass before a local VRF request expires and can be purged
- **Epoch expiration delay** - the number of epochs that must pass before a BABE request expires and can be purged
- **Minimum block delay** - the minimum number of blocks before a request can be fulfilled for local VRF requests
- **Maximum block delay** - the maximum number of blocks before a request can be fulfilled for local VRF requests
- **Maximum random words** - the maximum number of random words being requested
- **Epoch fulfillment delay** - the delay in epochs before a request can be fulfilled for a BABE request

## Local VRF {: #local-vrf }

Local VRF randomness is generated on a block-by-block basis at the beginning of the block using the previous block's VRF output along with the public key of the current block author's VRF key. The generated randomness result is stored and used to fulfill all randomness requests for the current block.

You can request local VRF randomness using the [`requestLocalVRFRandomWords` method](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/#:~:text=requestLocalVRFRandomWords){target=\_blank} of the [Randomness Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/){target=\_blank}.

If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the `requestId` returned from the `requestLocalVRFRandomWords` method to track which response is associated with which randomness request.

## BABE Epoch Randomness {: #babe-epoch-randomness }

BABE epoch randomness is based on a hash of the VRF values from the blocks produced in the relay chain epoch before last. On Polkadot, an [epoch lasts for roughly 4 hours](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-cryptography/#vrf){target=\_blank}, and on Kusama, an [epoch lasts for roughly 1 hour](https://wiki.polkadot.com/kusama/kusama-getting-started/#periods-of-common-actions-and-attributes){target=\_blank}. The hashing is completed on the relay chain, and as such, it is not possible for a collator on Moonbeam to influence the randomness value unless they are also a validator on the relay chain and were responsible for producing the last output included in an epoch.

The randomness remains constant during an epoch. If a collator skips block production, the next eligible collator can fulfill the request using the same random value.

You can request BABE epoch randomness using the [`requestRelayBabeEpochRandomWords` method](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/#:~:text=requestRelayBabeEpochRandomWords){target=\_blank} of the [Randomness Precompile](/builders/ethereum/precompiles/features/randomness/){target=\_blank}. In order to generate unique randomness, a different salt must be provided to the `requestRelayBabeEpochRandomWords` function.

At the beginning of each relay chain epoch change, the randomness from one epoch ago is read from the relay chain state proof and used to fulfill all randomness requests that are due in the current block.

## Request & Fulfill Process {: #request-and-fulfill-process }

In general, the request and fulfill process for randomness is as follows:

1. Pay the deposit required to request random words
2. Request the randomness either using the local VRF or BABE epoch source of randomness. When requesting randomness you'll need to specify a few things:

    - a refund address where any excess fees will be sent to
    - the amount of fees which will be set aside to pay for fulfillment. If the specified amount is not enough you can always increase the request fees later, or if it's more than enough you'll be refunded the excess fees to the specified address after fulfillment
    - a unique salt that will be used to generate different random words
    - the number of random words you would like to request
    - for local VRF, the delay period in blocks, which is used to increase unpredictability. It must be between the [minimum and maximum number of blocks](#quick-reference) as listed above. For BABE epoch randomness, you do not need to specify a delay but can fulfill the request after the [epoch delay](#quick-reference) has passed

3. Wait for the delay period to pass
4. Fulfill the randomness request, which triggers the random words to be computed using the current block's randomness result and the given salt. This can manually be done by anyone using the fee that was initially set aside for the request
5. For fulfilled requests, the random words are returned and the cost of execution will be refunded from the request fee to the address that initiated the fulfillment. Then any excess fees and the request deposit are transferred to the specified refund address

If a request expires it can be purged by anyone. When this happens, the request fee is paid out to the address that initiated the purge and the deposit is returned to the original requester.

The happy path for a randomness request is shown in the following diagram:

![Randomness request happy path diagram](/images/learn/features/randomness/randomness-1.webp)

## Security Considerations {: #security-considerations }

A method with the ability to call your `fulfillRandomness` method directly could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that it can only be directly called by the `RandomnessConsumer.sol` contract's `rawFulfillRandomness` method.

For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your `fulfillRandomness` method. If your contract must store the response (or anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.

Similarly, the collators have some influence over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously, you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.

Since the output of the random words generated for `requestLocalVRFRandomWords` is dependent on the collator producing the block at fulfillment, the collator could skip its block, forcing the fulfillment to be executed by a different collator and therefore generating a different VRF. However, such an attack would incur the cost of losing the block reward to the collator. It is also possible for a collator to be able to predict some of the possible outcome of the VRF if the delay between the request and the fulfillment is too short. It is for this reason that you can choose to provide a higher delay.

Since the output of the random words generated for `requestRelayBabeEpochRandomWords` is dependent on the relay chain validator producing the blocks during an epoch, it is possible for the last validator of an epoch to choose between two possible VRF outputs by skipping the production of a block. However, such an attack would incur the cost of losing the block reward to the validator. It is not possible for a parachain collator to predict or influence the output of the relay chain VRF, not to censor the fulfillment, as long as there is one honest collator.

# Staking on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam uses a block production mechanism based on [Polkadot's Proof-of-Stake model](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/polkadot-chain/pos-consensus/){target=\_blank}, where there are collators and validators. [Collators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-collator/){target=\_blank} maintain parachains (in this case, Moonbeam) by collecting transactions from users and producing state transition proofs for the relay chain [validators](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-validator/){target=\_blank}.

The candidates in the active set of collators (nodes that produce blocks) are selected based on their stake in the network. And here is where staking comes in.

Collator candidates (and token holders if they delegate) have a stake in the network. The top N candidates by staked amount are chosen to produce blocks with a valid set of transactions, where N is a configurable parameter. Part of each block reward goes to the collators that produced the block, who then share it with the delegators considering their percental contributions towards the collator's stake. In such a way, network members are incentivized to stake tokens to improve the overall security. Since staking is done at a protocol level through the staking interface, if you choose to delegate, the collators you delegate to do not have access to your tokens.

To easily manage staking related actions, you can visit the [Moonbeam Network DApp](https://apps.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} and use the network tabs at the top of the page to easily switch between Moonbeam networks. To learn how to use the DApp, you can check out the [How to Stake MOVR Tokens](https://moonbeam.network/news/how-to-stake-movr-tokens-on-moonriver-and-earn-staking-rewards){target=\_blank} guide or [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GwetYmzEJM){target=\_blank}, both of which can be adapted for the Moonbeam and the Moonbase Alpha TestNet.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

Some important parameters to understand in relation to the staking system on Moonbeam include:

 - **Round** — a specific number of blocks around which staking actions are enforced. For example, new delegations are enacted when the next round starts. When bonding less or revoking delegations, funds are returned after a specified number of rounds
 - **Candidates** - node operators that are eligible to become block producers if they can acquire enough stake to be in the active set
 - **Collators** — active set of candidates that are selected to be block producers. They collect transactions from users and produce state transition proofs for the relay chain to validate
 - **Delegators** — token holders who stake tokens, vouching for specific collator candidates. Any user that holds a minimum amount of tokens as [free balance](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-accounts/#balance-types#balance-types) can become a delegator
 - **Minimum delegation per candidate** — minimum amount of tokens to delegate candidates once a user is in the set of delegators
 - **Maximum delegators per candidate** — maximum number of delegators, by staked amount, that a candidate can have which are eligible to receive staking rewards
 - **Maximum delegations** — maximum number of candidates a delegator can delegate
 - **Exit delay** - an exit delay is the amount of rounds before a candidate or delegator can execute a scheduled request to decrease or revoke a bond, or leave the set of candidates or delegators
 - **Reward payout delay** - a certain amount of rounds must pass before staking rewards are distributed automatically to the free balance
 - **Reward pool** - a portion of the annual inflation that is set aside for collators and delegators
 - **Collator commission** - default fixed percent a collator takes off the top of the due staking rewards. Not related to the reward pool
 - **Delegator rewards** — the aggregate delegator rewards distributed over all eligible delegators, taking into account the relative size of stakes ([read more](/learn/features/staking/#reward-distribution))
 - **Auto-compounding** - a setting that automatically applies a percentage of a delegator's rewards to their total amount delegated
 - **Slashing** — a mechanism to discourage collator misbehavior, where typically the collator and their delegators get slashed by losing a percentage of their stake. Currently, there is no slashing but this can be changed through governance. Collators who produce blocks that are not finalized by the relay chain won't receive rewards

!!! note
    As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.

### General Tips {: #general-tips }

- To optimize your staking rewards, you should generally choose a collator with a lower total amount bonded. In that case, your delegation amount will represent a larger portion of the collator’s total stake and you will earn proportionally higher rewards. However, there is a higher risk of the collator being kicked out of the active set and not earning rewards at all
- The minimum bond for each collator tends to increase over time, so if your delegation is close to the minimum, there is a higher chance you might fall below the minimum and not receive rewards
- Spreading delegations between multiple collators is more efficient in terms of rewards, but only recommended if you have enough to stay above the minimum bond of each collator
- You can consider collator performance by reviewing the number of blocks each collator has produced recently
- You can set up auto-compounding which will automatically restake a specified percentage of your delegation rewards

## Reward Distribution {: #reward-distribution }

Rewards for collators and their delegators are calculated at the start of every round for their work prior to the [reward payout delay](#quick-reference). For example, on Moonriver the rewards are calculated for the collators work from {{ networks.moonriver.delegator_timings.rewards_payouts.rounds }} rounds ago.

The calculated rewards are then paid out on a block-by-block basis starting at the second block of the round. For every block, one collator will be chosen to receive their entire reward payout from the prior round, along with their delegators, until all rewards have been paid out for that round. For example, if there are {{ networks.moonriver.staking.max_candidates }} collators who produced blocks in the prior round, all of the collators and their delegators will be paid by block {{ networks.moonriver.staking.paid_out_block }} of the new round.

You can choose to auto-compound your delegation rewards so you no longer have to manually delegate rewards. If you choose to set up auto-compounding, you can specify the percentage of rewards to be auto-compounded. These rewards will then be automatically added to your delegation.

### Annual Inflation {: #annual-inflation}

The distribution of the annual inflation goes as follows:

=== "Moonbeam"
    |                 Variable                  |                                         Value                                         |
    |:-----------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |             Annual inflation              |               {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.total_annual_inflation }}%               |
    | Rewards pool for collators and delegators | {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.delegator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation |
    |            Collator commission            | {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.collator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |
    |          Parachain bond reserve           |  {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.parachain_bond_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |

=== "Moonriver"
    |                 Variable                  |                                         Value                                          |
    |:-----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |             Annual inflation              |               {{ networks.moonriver.inflation.total_annual_inflation }}%               |
    | Rewards pool for collators and delegators | {{ networks.moonriver.inflation.delegator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation |
    |            Collator commission            | {{ networks.moonriver.inflation.collator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |
    |          Parachain bond reserve           |  {{ networks.moonriver.inflation.parachain_bond_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |

=== "Moonbase Alpha"
    |                 Variable                  |                                         Value                                         |
    |:-----------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |             Annual inflation              |               {{ networks.moonbase.inflation.total_annual_inflation }}%               |
    | Rewards pool for collators and delegators | {{ networks.moonbase.inflation.delegator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation |
    |            Collator commission            | {{ networks.moonbase.inflation.collator_reward_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |
    |          Parachain bond reserve           |  {{ networks.moonbase.inflation.parachain_bond_inflation }}% of the annual inflation  |

From the rewards pool, collators get the rewards corresponding to their stake in the network. The rest are distributed among delegators by stake.

### Calculating Rewards {: #calculating-rewards }

Mathematically speaking, for collators, the reward distribution per block proposed and finalized would look like this:

![Staking Collator Reward](/images/learn/features/staking/staking-overview-1.webp)

Where `amount_due` is the corresponding inflation being distributed in a specific block, the `stake` corresponds to the number of tokens bonded by the collator in respect to the total stake of that collator (accounting delegations).

For each delegator, the reward distribution (per block proposed and finalized by the delegated collator) would look like this:

![Staking Delegator Reward](/images/learn/features/staking/staking-overview-2.webp)

Where `amount_due` is the corresponding inflation being distributed in a specific block, the `stake` corresponds to the amount of tokens bonded by each delegator in respect to the total stake of that collator.

## Risks {: #risks }

*Holders of MOVR/GLMR tokens should perform careful due diligence on collators before delegating. Being listed as a collator is not an endorsement or recommendation from the Moonbeam Network, the Moonriver Network, or Moonbeam Foundation. Neither the Moonbeam Network, Moonriver Network, nor Moonbeam Foundation has vetted the list collators and assumes no responsibility with regard to the selection, performance, security, accuracy, or use of any third-party offerings.  You alone are responsible for doing your own diligence to understand the applicable fees and all risks present, including actively monitoring the activity of your collators.*

*You agree and understand that neither the Moonbeam Network, the Moonriver Network, nor Moonbeam Foundation guarantees that you will receive staking rewards and any applicable percentage provided (i) is an estimate only and not guaranteed, (ii) may change at any time and (iii) may be more or less than the actual staking rewards you receive. The Moonbeam Foundation makes no representations as to the monetary value of any rewards at any time.*

*Staking MOVR/GLMR tokens is not free of risk.*
*Staked MOVR/GLMR tokens are locked up, and retrieving them requires a {{ networks.moonriver.delegator_timings.del_bond_less.days }} day/{{ networks.moonbeam.delegator_timings.del_bond_less.days }} day waiting period .*
*Additionally, if a collator fails to perform required functions or acts in bad faith, a portion of their total stake can be slashed (i.e. destroyed). This includes the stake of their delegators. If a collators behaves suspiciously or is too often offline, delegators can choose to unbond from them or switch to another collator. Delegators can also mitigate risk by electing to distribute their stake across multiple collators.*

# Treasury on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Moonbeam Treasury is an on-chain collection of funds launched at the network's genesis. Initially pre-funded with 0.5% of the token supply, the Treasury continues to accumulate GLMR as {{ networks.moonbeam.inflation.parachain_bond_treasury }}% of the parachain bond reserve inflation goes to the Treasury. For more information about Moonbeam inflation figures, see [GLMR Tokenomics](https://moonbeam.foundation/glimmer-token-tokenomics/){target=\_blank}.

The Moonbeam Treasury funds initiatives that support and grow the network. Stakeholders can propose spending requests for Treasury Council review, focusing on efforts like integrations, collaborations, community events, and outreach. Treasury spend proposers must submit their proposals to the [Moonbeam Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/treasury-proposals/8){target=\_blank}. For submission details, see [How to Propose a Treasury Spend](/tokens/governance/treasury-spend/){target=\_blank}.

The [Treasury Council](https://forum.moonbeam.network/g/TreasuryCouncil){target=\_blank} oversees the spending of the Moonbeam Treasury and votes on funding proposals. It comprises two members from the Moonbeam Foundation and three external community members. The three external members are elected to terms of {{ networks.moonbeam.treasury.months_elected }} months. The same Treasury Council oversees Treasury requests for both Moonbeam and Moonriver. The Council meets monthly to review proposals submitted on the [Moonbeam Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/treasury-proposals/8){target=\_blank}. Once a proposal is agreed upon, the Council members must complete the on-chain approval process.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

Some important terminology to understand regarding treasuries:

- **Treasury Council** — a group of Moonbeam Foundation representatives and external community members. The Council reviews funding proposals, ensures alignment with the community, and ultimately authorizes Treasury spending
- **Proposal** — a plan or suggestion submitted by stakeholders to further the network to be approved by the Treasury Council

## Treasury Addresses {: #treasury-addresses }

The Treasury address for each respective network can be found below:

=== "Moonbeam"

    [0x6d6F646c70632f74727372790000000000000000](https://moonbase.subscan.io/account/0x6d6F646c70632f74727372790000000000000000){target=_blank}

=== "Moonriver"

    [0x6d6F646c70632f74727372790000000000000000](https://moonbase.subscan.io/account/0x6d6F646c70632f74727372790000000000000000){target=_blank}


## Roadmap of a Treasury Proposal {: #roadmap-of-a-treasury-proposal }

The happy path of a Treasury spend request is as follows:

1. **Proposal submission** - the user submits a proposal to the [Moonbeam Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/treasury-proposals/8){target=\_blank}

2. **Forum discussion** - the proposal is discussed by the community on the Forum. The ultimate Aye/Nay decision is determined by the Treasury council

3. **Treasury approval and action** - if the Treasury Council agrees, it authorizes the Treasury spending and moves the process forward

## Treasury Council Voting Process {: #treasury-council-voting-process }

A member of the Treasury Council will submit a `treasury.spend` call. This call requires specifying the amount, the asset type, and the beneficiary account to receive the funds. The Treasury supports spending various token types beyond GLMR, including native USDT/USDC. Once this extrinsic is submitted, a new Treasury Council collective proposal will be created and made available for council members to vote on. Once approved through the Treasury Council's internal voting process, the funds will be released automatically to the beneficiary account through the `treasury.payout` extrinsic.
 
!!! note
    There is no on-chain action for the proposer or beneficiary of the Treasury spend request.
    All Treasury spend actions will be completed by members of the Treasury Council.

Note that this process has changed significantly from prior Treasury processes, where tokenholders could submit Treasury proposals with bonds attached. Now, no on-chain action is necessary to submit a Treasury proposal. Rather, all that is needed is to raise a Treasury Council request on the [Moonbeam Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.network/c/governance/treasury-proposals/8){target=\_blank} and the Treasury Council will take care of the on-chain components.

# Overview of the Precompiled Contracts on Moonbeam

## Overview {: #introduction }

On Moonbeam, a precompiled contract is native Substrate code that has an Ethereum-style address and can be called using the Ethereum API, like any other smart contract. The precompiles allow you to call the Substrate runtime directly which is not normally accessible from the Ethereum side of Moonbeam.

The Substrate code responsible for implementing precompiles can be found in the [EVM pallet](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/){target=\_blank}. The EVM pallet includes the [standard precompiles found on Ethereum and some additional precompiles that are not specific to Ethereum](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm/precompile){target=\_blank}. It also provides the ability to create and execute custom precompiles through the generic [`Precompiles` trait](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/trait.Precompile.html){target=\_blank}. There are several custom Moonbeam-specific precompiles that have been created, all of which can be found in the [Moonbeam codebase](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/tree/master/precompiles){target=\_blank}. It is important to highlight that the precompiles from this list with the `CallableByContract` check are not callable inside the contract constructor.

The Ethereum precompiled contracts contain complex functionality that is computationally intensive, such as hashing and encryption. The custom precompiled contracts on Moonbeam provide access to Substrate-based functionality such as staking, governance, XCM-related functions, and more.

The Moonbeam-specific precompiles can be interacted with through familiar and easy-to-use Solidity interfaces using the Ethereum API, which are ultimately used to interact with the underlying Substrate interface. This flow is depicted in the following diagram:

![Precompiled Contracts Diagram](/images/builders/ethereum/precompiles/overview/overview-1.webp)

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam. Please refer to the [Security Considerations](/learn/core-concepts/security/){target=\_blank} page for more information.

## Precompiled Contract Addresses {: #precompiled-contract-addresses }

The precompiled contracts are categorized by address and based on the origin network. If you were to convert the precompiled addresses to decimal format, and break them into categories by numeric value, the categories are as follows:

- **0-1023** - [Ethereum MainNet precompiles](#ethereum-mainnet-precompiles)
- **1024-2047** - precompiles that are [not in Ethereum and not Moonbeam specific](#non-moonbeam-specific-nor-ethereum-precomiles)
- **2048-4095** - [Moonbeam specific precompiles](#moonbeam-specific-precompiles)

# Block Explorers

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Block explorers can be thought of as search engines for the blockchain. They allow users to search for information such as balances, contracts, and transactions. More advanced block explorers even offer indexing capabilities, which enable them to provide a complete set of information, such as ERC-20 tokens in the network. They might even offer API services to access it via external services.

Moonbeam provides two different kinds of explorers: ones to query the Ethereum API and others  dedicated to the Substrate API. All EVM-based transactions are accessible via the Ethereum API, while the Substrate API can be relied upon for Substrate-native functions such as governance and staking. The Substrate API also includes information about the EVM-based transactions, but only limited information is shown.

## Ethereum API {: #ethereum-api }

### Moonscan {: #Moonscan }

[Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank} is the primary Ethereum API block explorer for Moonbeam-based networks. Built by the Etherscan team, Moonscan provides a powerful, intuitive, and feature-rich experience. In addition to its comprehensive transaction and block data, Moonscan provides a number of [statistics and charts](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/charts){target=\_blank}, such as average gas price, daily transactions, and block size charts.

Other Moonscan features include:

 - [Collator leaderboard](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/collators){target=\_blank} ranking collators by performance
 - [Contract source code verification](/builders/ethereum/verify-contracts/block-explorers/){target=\_blank}, accessible both via a web interface and an API
 - Ability to read and write state data of verified smart contracts
 - [Token approvals](https://moonscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker){target=\_blank} where you can view and revoke any of your prior token approvals
 - [Adding token information](/builders/get-started/token-profile/){target=\_blank} and creating a profile for ERC-20s, ERC-721s, and ERC-1155s deployed to Moonbeam-based networks. The profile can include links to your project, social media, price data, and other information pertaining to your token

### Expedition {: #expedition }

A Moonbeam-themed version of the [Expedition](https://github.com/xops/expedition){target=\_blank} explorer can be found in [this link](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app){target=\_blank}. It is a basic JSON-RPC based explorer.

By default, the explorer is connected to Moonbeam. However, you can switch to Moonriver or Moonbase Alpha, or connect it to a local dev node by following the next steps:

 1. Click on the network text, where you'll be able to select between all different networks, including a **Moonbeam Development Node** running on `{{ networks.development.rpc_url }}`
 2. In the case you want to connect to a specific RPC URL, select **Add Custom Chain** and enter the URL. For example, `http://localhost:9937`

![Expedition Explorer](/images/builders/get-started/explorers/explorers-2.webp)

## Substrate API {: #substrate-api }

### Subscan {: #subscan }

[Subscan](https://moonbeam.subscan.io){target=\_blank} is the primary Substrate API block explorer for Moonbeam-based networks. Subscan is capable of parsing standard or custom modules. For example, this is useful to display information regarding the Staking, Governance, and EVM pallets (or modules). The code is all open-source and can be found in the [Subscan Essentials GitHub repo](https://github.com/subscan-explorer/subscan-essentials){target=\_blank}.

![Subscan Moonbeam](/images/builders/get-started/explorers/explorers-3.webp)

### Polkadot.js {: #polkadotjs }

While not a full-featured block explorer, Polkadot.js Apps is a convenient option especially for users running local development nodes to view events and query transaction hashes. Polkadot.js Apps uses the WebSocket endpoint to interact with the Network. You can easily connect to [Moonbeam](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}, [Moonriver](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonriver.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}, or [Moonbase Alpha](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}.

![Polkadot.js Moonbeam](/images/builders/get-started/explorers/explorers-4.webp)

To connect it to a Moonbeam development node, you can follow the steps in the [Connecting Polkadot.js Apps to a Local Moonbeam Node](/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam-dev/#connecting-polkadot-js-apps-to-a-local-moonbeam-node){target=\_blank} section of the [Getting Started with a Moonbeam Development Node](/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam-dev/){target=\_blank} guide. The default port for this is `9944`.

#### Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

To connect to the Moonbase Alpha relay chain, you can use the following WS Endpoint:

| Provider |                          RPC URL                           |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| OpsLayer | <pre>```wss://relay.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network```</pre> |

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonbase Alpha:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network';
// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1287,
    name: 'moonbase-alphanet'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonbase Alpha TestNet chain ID is: `1287`, which is `0x507` in hex.

## Block Explorers

For Moonbase Alpha, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonbase.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=MoonbaseAlpha){target=\_blank}
 - **Substrate API** — [Subscan](https://moonbase.subscan.io){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}

For more information on each of the available block explorers, please head to the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation.

## Connect MetaMask

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbase">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Moonbase Alpha as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Moonbase Alpha.

If you do not have MetaMask installed, or would like to follow a tutorial to get started, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank} guide.

2. Connect your MetaMask wallet and ensure you're on the Moonbase Alpha network
3. Press **Choose a List** on the prompt
4. Select **Moon Menu**
5. Search for or select your desired asset from the list then continue with the swap

![Moonbeam Swap](/images/builders/get-started/networks/moonbase/moonbase-3.webp)

!!! note
    If you see only a partial list of assets under **Moon Menu**, your browser may have cached an older version of **Moon Menu**. Clearing the cache and re-adding **Moon Menu** will resolve this.



### MoonLotto Lottery {: #moonlotto-lottery }

[MoonLotto](https://moonbase-moonlotto.netlify.app){target=\_blank} is a simple lottery game on Moonbase Alpha derived from [The Graph's Example Subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph){target=\_blank}.  Purchasing a ticket costs 1 DEV and a winner is chosen each half hour if there are at least 10 participants. [MoonLotto.sol](https://github.com/papermoonio/moonlotto-subgraph/blob/main/contracts/MoonLotto.sol){target=\_blank} holds the contract logic for the lottery. To participate, take the following steps:

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet and ensure you're on the Moonbase Alpha network
2. Enter the address of the recipient of lotto ticket or check **I want to buy a ticket for my address**
3. Press **Submit on MetaMask** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask

![MoonLotto Lottery](/images/builders/get-started/networks/moonbase/moonbase-5.webp)

### Moonbeam WalletConnect {: #moonbeam-walletconnect }

### MoonGas {: #moongas }

[MoonGas](https://moonbeam-gasinfo.netlify.app){target=\_blank} is a convenient dashboard for viewing the minimum, maximum, and average gas price of transactions in the prior block across all Moonbeam networks. Note, these statistics can fluctuate widely by block and occasionally include outlier values. You can check out the [repository for MoonGas](https://github.com/albertov19/moonbeam-gas-station){target=\_blank}.

You'll notice that the minimum gas price for Moonbeam is {{ networks.moonbeam.min_gas_price }} Gwei, while the minimum for Moonriver is {{ networks.moonriver.min_gas_price }} Gwei and Moonbase Alpha is {{ networks.moonbase.min_gas_price }} Gwei. This difference stems from the [100 to 1 re-denomination of GLMR](https://moonbeam.network/news/moonbeam-foundation-announces-liquidity-programs-a-new-token-event-and-glmr-redenomination){target=\_blank} and thus the {{ networks.moonbeam.min_gas_price }} Gwei minimum on Moonbeam corresponds to a {{ networks.moonriver.min_gas_price }} Gwei minimum on Moonriver and a {{ networks.moonbase.min_gas_price }} Gwei on Moonbase.

## Introduction {: #introduction }

A Moonbeam development node is your own personal development environment for building and testing applications on Moonbeam. For Ethereum developers, it is comparable to the Hardhat Network. It enables you to get started quickly and easily without the overhead of a relay chain. You can spin up your node with the `--sealing` option to author blocks instantly, manually, or at a custom interval after transactions are received. By default, a block will be created when a transaction is received, which is similar to the default behavior of Hardhat Network's instamine feature.

If you follow this guide to the end, you will have a Moonbeam development node running in your local environment with 10 prefunded [accounts](#pre-funded-development-accounts).

!!! note
    This tutorial was created using the {{ networks.development.build_tag }} tag of [Moonbase Alpha](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/{{ networks.development.build_tag }}){target=\_blank}. The Moonbeam platform and the [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} components it relies on for Substrate-based Ethereum compatibility are still under very active development.
    The examples in this guide assume you have a MacOS or Ubuntu 22.04-based environment and will need to be adapted accordingly for Windows.

## Spin Up a Moonbeam Development Node {: #spin-up-a-node }

There are two ways to get started running a Moonbeam node. You can use [Docker to run a pre-built binary](#getting-started-with-docker) or you can [compile the binary locally](#getting-started-with-the-binary-file) and set up a development node yourself. Using Docker is a quick and convenient way to get started, as you won't have to install Substrate and all the dependencies, and you can skip the node-building process as well. It does require you to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/){target=\_blank}. On the other hand, if you decide you want to go through the process of building your development node, it could take roughly 30 minutes or longer to complete, depending on your hardware.

### Spin Up a Node with Docker {: #getting-started-with-docker }

Using Docker enables you to spin up a node in a matter of seconds. Once you have Docker installed, you can take the following steps to spin up your node:

1. Execute the following command to download the latest Moonbeam image:

    ```bash
    docker pull moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }}
    ```

    The tail end of the console log should look like this:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>docker pull moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.49.2</span>
  <br>
  <span data-ty>v0.49.2: Pulling from moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam
    <br> b0a0cf830b12: Pull complete
    <br> fbff687640dd: Pull complete
    <br> 58ea427410e2: Pull complete
    <br> 811ba55e6e61: Pull complete
    <br> 4316d5f1b914: Pull complete
    <br> 128693ce218e: Pull complete
    <br> a3ac90b88463: Pull complete
    <br> Digest: sha256:86421aca2381265cd2e5283cb98705e24be0bc92a73937363f79d9d6e0d62088
    <br> Status: Downloaded newer image for moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.49.2
    <br> docker.io/moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.49.2
  </span>
</div>

2. Spin up a Moonbeam development node by running the following Docker command, which will launch the node in instant seal mode for local testing so that blocks are authored instantly as transactions are received:

    === "Ubuntu"

        ```bash
        docker run --rm --name {{ networks.development.container_name }} --network host \
        moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }} \
        --dev --rpc-external
        ```

    === "MacOS"

        ```bash
        docker run --rm --name {{ networks.development.container_name }} -p 9944:9944 \
        moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }} \
        --dev --rpc-external
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```bash
        docker run --rm --name {{ networks.development.container_name }} -p 9944:9944 ^
        moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }} ^
        --dev --rpc-external
        ```

    !!! note "For Apple Silicon users"
        If the Docker commands fail or behave unexpectedly on Apple Silicon, enable **Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon** in Docker Desktop settings and use the `amd64` platform for both pull and run commands:

        ```bash
        docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }}
        ```

        ```bash
        docker run --rm --platform=linux/amd64 --name {{ networks.development.container_name }} -p 9944:9944 \
        moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:{{ networks.development.build_tag }} \
        --dev --rpc-external
        ```

        If performance is still insufficient, consider [spinning up a node with a binary file](#getting-started-with-the-binary-file).

If successful, you should see an output showing an idle state waiting for blocks to be authored:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>docker run --rm --name moonbeam_development --network host \
    <br> moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.49.2 \
    <br> --dev --rpc-external
  </span>
  <br>
  <span data-ty>CLI parameter `--execution` has no effect anymore and will be removed in the future!

To continue with the tutorial, the next section is not necessary, as you've already spun up a node with Docker. You can skip ahead to the [Configure your Moonbeam Development Node](#configure-moonbeam-dev-node) section.

### Spin Up a Node with a Binary File {: #getting-started-with-the-binary-file }

As an alternative to using Docker, you can spin up a node using the Moonbeam binary. This method is more time-consuming. Depending on your hardware, the process could take around 30 minutes to complete.

!!! note
    If you know what you are doing, you can directly download the precompiled binaries attached to each release on the [Moonbeam release page](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank}. These will not work in all systems. For example, the binaries only work with x86-64 Linux with specific versions of dependencies. The safest way to ensure compatibility is to compile the binary on the system where it will be run.

To build the binary file, you can take the following steps:

1. Clone a specific tag of the Moonbeam repo, which you can find on the [Moonbeam GitHub repository](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam){target=\_blank}:

    ```bash
    git clone -b {{ networks.development.build_tag }} https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam
    cd moonbeam
    ```

    !!! note
        Spaces in the installation file path will cause a compilation error.

2. Check if Rust is installed. If Rust is installed, skip the next two steps. Otherwise, install Rust and its prerequisites [via Rust's recommended method](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/){target=\_blank} by executing:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

3. Update your PATH environment variable by running:

    ```bash
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

4. Build the development node by running:

    !!! note
        If you are using Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04, then you will need to make sure these additional dependencies have been installed before building the binary:

        ```bash
        apt install clang protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev pkg-config libssl-dev -y 
        ```

        For MacOS users, these dependencies can be installed via Homebrew:

        ```bash
        brew install llvm
        brew install protobuf
        ```

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

!!! note
    The initial build will take a while. Depending on your hardware, you should expect approximately 30 minutes for the build process to finish.

Then, you will want to run the node in development mode using the following command:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam --dev
```

!!! note
    For people not familiar with Substrate, the `--dev` flag is a way to run a Substrate-based node in a single-node developer configuration for testing purposes. When you run your node with the `--dev` flag, your node is started in a fresh state, and its state does not persist.

You should see an output that looks like the following, showing an idle state waiting for blocks to be produced:

For more information on some of the flags and options used in the example, check out the [Flags](#node-flags) and [Options](#node-options). If you want to see a complete list of all of the flags, options, and subcommands, open the help menu by running:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam --help
```

## Configure Your Moonbeam Development Node {: #configure-moonbeam-dev-node }

Now that you know how to get a standard Moonbeam development node up and running, you may be wondering how you can configure it. The following sections will cover some common configurations you can use when you spin up your node.

### Common Flags to Configure Your Node {: #node-flags }

Flags do not take an argument. To use a flag, add it to the end of a command. For example:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam --dev
```

- **`--dev`** - specifies the development chain
- **`--tmp`** - runs a temporary node in which all of the configuration will be deleted at the end of the process
- **`--rpc-external`** - listen to all RPC and WebSocket interfaces

### Common Options to Configure Your Node {: #node-options }

Options accept an argument to the right of the option. For example:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam --dev --sealing 6000
```

- **`-l <log pattern>` or `--log <log pattern>`** - sets a custom logging filter. The syntax for the log pattern is `<target>=<level>`. For example, to print all of the JSON-RPC logs, the command would look like this: `-l json=trace`
- **`--sealing <interval>`** - when blocks should be sealed in the dev service. Accepted arguments for interval: `instant`, `manual`, or a number representing the timer interval in milliseconds (for example, `6000` will have the node produce blocks every 6 seconds). The default is `instant``. Please refer to the [Configure Block Production](#configure-block-production) section below for more information
- **`--rpc-port <port>`** - sets the unified port for HTTP and WS connections. Accepts a port as the argument. Default is {{ networks.parachain.rpc }}
- **`--ws-port <port>`** - *deprecated as of [client v0.33.0](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/v0.33.0){target=\_blank}, use `--rpc-port` for HTTP and WS connections instead* - sets the WebSockets RPC server TCP port. As of [client v0.30.0](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/v0.30.0){target=\_blank}, it sets the unified port for both HTTP and WS connections. Accepts a port as the argument
- **`--rpc-max-connections <connections>`** - specifies the combined HTTP and WS connection limit. The default is 100 connections
- **`--ws-max-connections <connections>`** - *deprecated as of [client v0.33.0](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/tag/v0.33.0){target=\_blank}, use `--rpc-max-connections` to limit the HTTP and WS connections instead* - this flag adjusts the combined HTTP and WS connection limit. The default is 100 connections
- **`--rpc-cors <origins>`** - specifies the browser origins allowed to access the HTTP and WS RPC servers. The origins can be a comma-separated list of the origins to allow access, or you can also specify `null`. When running a development node, the default is to allow all origins

For a complete list of flags and options, spin up your Moonbeam development node with `--help` added to the end of the command.

### Configure Block Production {: #configure-block-production }

By default, your Moonbeam development node is spun up in instant seal mode, which instantly authors blocks as transactions are received. However, you can specify when blocks should be authored or sealed by using the `--sealing` option.

The `--sealing` flag accepts any of the following arguments:

- `instant` - as we already covered, this is the default option in which blocks are authored as soon as a transaction is received
- `manual` - allows you to produce blocks manually. If a transaction is received, a block will not be produced until you manually create one
- an interval in milliseconds - authors a block on a specific time interval. For example, if you set it to `6000`, you will have the node produce blocks every 6 seconds

The flag should be appended to the start-up command in the following format:

```text
--sealing <interval>
```

If you choose `manual`, you'll need to manually create the blocks yourself, which can be done with the `engine_createBlock` JSON-RPC method:

```text
engine_createBlock(createEmpty: *bool*, finalize: *bool*, parentHash?: *BlockHash*)
```

For example, you can use the following snippet to manually create a block using [Ethers.js](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, an Ethereum library that makes it easy to interact with JSON-RPC methods:

```js
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const produceBlock = async () => {
  // Connect to the Ethereum node (if applicable, replace the URL with your node's address)
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(
    '{{ networks.development.rpc_url }}'
  );

  // Set the custom JSON-RPC method and parameters
  const method = 'engine_createBlock';
  const params = [true, true, null];

  try {
    // Send the custom JSON-RPC call
    const result = await provider.send(method, params);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that may occur
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  }
};

produceBlock();
```

!!! note
    If you're unfamiliar with Ethers, please refer to the [Ethers.js](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank} documentation page to learn more.

## Prefunded Development Accounts {: #pre-funded-development-accounts }

Moonbeam has a [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} system, which enables users to have an Ethereum-styled H160 account that can interact with the Substrate API and the Ethereum API. As a result, you can interact with your account through [Polkadot.js Apps](/tokens/connect/polkadotjs/#connect-polkadotjs-apps){target=\_blank} or [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank} (or any other [EVM wallet](/tokens/connect/){target=\_blank}). In addition, you can also use other [development tools](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/){target=\_blank}, such as [Remix](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} and [Hardhat](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/hardhat/){target=\_blank}.

Your Moonbeam development node comes with ten prefunded Ethereum-styled accounts for development. The addresses are derived from Substrate's canonical development mnemonic:

```text
bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk
```

## Development Node Endpoints {: #access-your-development-node }

You can access your Moonbeam development node using the following RPC and WSS endpoints:

=== "HTTP"

    ```text
    {{ networks.development.rpc_url }}
    ```

=== "WSS"

    ```text
    {{ networks.development.wss_url }}
    ```

## Block Explorers {: #block-explorers }

For a Moonbeam development node, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Substrate API** — [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944#/explorer){target=\_blank} on WS port `{{ networks.parachain.ws }}`
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC-based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=MoonbeamDevNode){target=\_blank} on HTTP port `{{ networks.parachain.ws }}`

## Debug, Trace, and TxPool APIs {: #debug-trace-txpool-apis }

You can also gain access to some non-standard RPC methods by running a tracing node, which allows developers to inspect and debug transactions during runtime. Tracing nodes use a different Docker image than a standard Moonbeam development node.

To learn how to run a Moonbeam development tracing node, check out the [Run a Tracing Node](/node-operators/networks/tracing-node/){target=\_blank} guide, and be sure to switch to the **Moonbeam Development Node** tab throughout the instructions. Then, to access the non-standard RPC methods with your tracing node, check out the [Debug & Trace](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Purge a Development Node {: #purging-your-node }

If you want to remove data associated with your node, you can purge it. The instructions for purging a node are different depending on how you initially spun up your node.

### Purge a Node Spun Up with Docker {: #purge-docker-node }

If you spun up your node using Docker along with the `-v` flag to specify a mounted directory for your container, you will need to purge that directory. To do so, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo rm -rf {{ networks.moonbase.node_directory }}/*
```

If you followed the instructions in this guide and did not use the `-v` flag, you can stop and remove the Docker container. The associated data will be removed along with it. To do so, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker stop `CONTAINER_ID` && docker rm `CONTAINER_ID`
```

### Purge a Node Spun up with a Binary File {: #purge-binary-node }

When running a node via the binary file, data is stored in a local directory, typically located in `~/.local/shared/moonbeam/chains/development/db`. If you want to start a fresh instance of the node, you can either delete the content of the folder or run the following command inside the `moonbeam` folder:

```bash
./target/release/moonbeam purge-chain --dev -y
```

This will remove the data folder. Note that all chain data is now lost. To learn more about all of the available `purge-chain` commands, you can check out the [Purging Binary Data](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#purging-compiled-binary){target=\_blank} section of our documentation.

# Get Started with Moonbeam

## Network Endpoints {: #network-endpoints }

Moonbeam has two types of endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

If you're looking for your own endpoints suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. Otherwise, to get started quickly you can use one of the following public HTTPS or WSS endpoints:

=== "HTTPS"
    |  Provider   |                              RPC URL                               |   Limits    |
    |:-----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

Before getting started, make sure you've retrieved your own endpoint and API key from one of the custom [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}. For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonbeam:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT'; // Insert your RPC URL here

// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1284,
    name: 'moonbeam'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonbeam chain ID is: `1284`, or `0x504` in hex.

## Block Explorers {: #block-explorers }

For Moonbeam, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=Moonbeam){target=\_blank}
 - **Substrate API** — [Subscan](https://moonbeam.subscan.io){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}

For more information on each of the available block explorers, please head to the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation.

## Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to Moonbeam:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonbeam">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Moonbeam as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Moonbeam.

If you do not have MetaMask installed, or would like to follow a tutorial to get started, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Configuration {: #configuration }

Please note the following gas configuration parameters. These values are subject to change in future runtime upgrades.


|       Variable        |                   Value                    |
|:---------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
|   Minimum gas price   | {{ networks.moonbeam.min_gas_price }} Gwei |
|   Target block time   | {{ networks.moonbeam.block_time }} seconds |
|    Block gas limit    |     {{ networks.moonbeam.gas_block }}      |
| Transaction gas limit |       {{ networks.moonbeam.gas_tx }}       |

      |  Provider   |                               RPC URL                               |   Limits    |
      |:-----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
      | OnFinality  |     <pre>```https://moonriver.api.onfinality.io/public```</pre>     | 40 req/sec  |
      | UnitedBloc  |          <pre>```https://moonriver.unitedbloc.com```</pre>          | 32 req/sec  |
      | RadiumBlock | <pre>```https://moonriver.public.curie.radiumblock.co/http```</pre> | 200 req/sec |

=== "WSS"
    |  Provider   |                             RPC URL                             |   Limits    |
    |:-----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|

    | RadiumBlock | <pre>```wss://moonriver.public.curie.radiumblock.co/ws```</pre> | 200 req/sec |

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

Before getting started, make sure you've retrieved your own endpoint and API key from one of the custom [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}. For the [Ethers.js library](/builders/ethereum/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, define the provider by using `ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {object})` and setting the provider URL to Moonriver:

```js
const ethers = require('ethers'); // Load Ethers library

const providerURL = 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT'; // Insert your RPC URL here

// Define provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerURL, {
    chainId: 1285,
    name: 'moonriver'
});
```

Any Ethereum wallet should be able to generate a valid address for Moonbeam (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}).

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

Moonriver chain ID is: `1285`, or `0x505` in hex.

## Block Explorers {: #block-explorers }

For Moonriver, you can use any of the following block explorers:

 - **Ethereum API (Etherscan Equivalent)** — [Moonscan](https://moonriver.moonscan.io){target=\_blank}
 - **Ethereum API JSON-RPC based** — [Moonbeam Basic Explorer](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/?network=Moonriver){target=\_blank}
 - **Substrate API** — [Subscan](https://moonriver.subscan.io){target=\_blank} or [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonriver.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=\_blank}
 
For more information on each of the available block explorers, please head to the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/) section of the documentation.

## Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to Moonriver:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonriver">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Moonriver as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Moonriver.

If you do not have MetaMask installed, or would like to follow a tutorial to get started, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/) guide.

## Configuration {: #configuration }

Please note the following gas configuration parameters. These values are subject to change in future runtime upgrades.

|       Variable        |                    Value                    |

# Quick Start Guide for Developing on Moonbeam

## Quick Overview {: #overview }

Moonbeam is a fully Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on Polkadot. As such, you can interact with Moonbeam via the [Ethereum API](/builders/ethereum/){target=\_blank} and [Substrate API](/builders/substrate/){target=\_blank}.

Although Moonbeam is a Substrate-based platform, it uses a [unified accounts](/learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/){target=\_blank} system, which replaces Substrate-style accounts and keys with Ethereum-style accounts and keys. As a result, you can interact with your Moonbeam account with [MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}, [Ledger](/tokens/connect/ledger/){target=\_blank}, and other Ethereum-compatible wallets by simply adding Moonbeam's network configurations. Similarly, you can develop on Moonbeam using Ethereum [libraries](/builders/ethereum/libraries/){target=\_blank} and [development environments](/builders/ethereum/dev-env/){target=\_blank}.

## Moonbeam Networks {: #moonbeam-networks }

To get started developing on Moonbeam, it's important to be aware of the various networks within the Moonbeam ecosystem.

| [Moonbeam Development Node](/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam-dev/){target=\_blank} | Local TestNet |                                       None                                       |         DEV         |          18           |

!!! note
    A Moonbeam development node doesn't have a relay chain as its purpose is to be your own personal development environment where you can get started developing quickly without the overhead of a relay chain.

### Network Configurations {: #network-configurations }

When working with developer tools, depending on the tool, you might need to configure Moonbeam to interact with the network. To do so, you can use the following information:

=== "Moonbeam"

    |    Variable     |                                                 Value                                                  |

!!! note
    You can create your own endpoint suitable for development or production from one of the [supported RPC providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/#endpoint-providers){target=\_blank}.

### Block Explorers {: #explorers }

Moonbeam provides two different kinds of explorers: ones to query the Ethereum API, and others dedicated to the Substrate API. All EVM-based transactions are accessible via the Ethereum API whereas the Substrate API can be relied upon for Substrate-native functions such as governance, staking, and some information about EVM-based transactions. For more information on each explorer, please check out the [Block Explorers](/builders/get-started/explorers/){target=\_blank} page.

title: XCM Instructions
description: When XCM instructions are combined, they form an XCM message that performs a cross-chain action. Take a look at some of the most common instructions.
categories: XCM, Basics

# XCM Instructions

## Introduction {: #introduction }

XCM messages contain a series of [actions and instructions](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#5-the-xcvm-instruction-set){target=\_blank} that are executed by the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM). An action (for example, transferring a token from one blockchain to another) consists of instructions that the XCVM partly executes in the origin and destination chains.

For example, an XCM message that transfers DOT from Polkadot to Moonbeam will include the following XCM instructions (in that order), some of which are executed on Polkadot and some of which are executed on Moonbeam:

 1. [TransferReserveAsset](#transfer-reserve-asset) — executed in Polkadot
 2. [ReserveAssetDeposited](#reserve-asset-deposited) — executed in Moonbeam
 3. [ClearOrigin](#clear-origin) — executed in Moonbeam
 4. [BuyExecution](#buy-execution) — executed in Moonbeam
 5. [DepositAsset](#deposit-asset) — executed in Moonbeam

Building the instructions for an XCM message from scratch is not an easy task. Consequently, there are wrapper functions and pallets that developers can leverage to use XCM features. The [Polkadot XCM](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank} and [XCM Transactor](/builders/interoperability/xcm/remote-execution/substrate-calls/xcm-transactor-pallet/){target=\_blank} Pallets provide functions with a predefined set of XCM instructions to either send [XC-20s](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/){target=\_blank} or remotely execute on other chains via XCM.

If you're interested in experimenting with different combinations of instructions, you can [use the Polkadot XCM Pallet to execute and send custom XCM messages](/builders/interoperability/xcm/send-execute-xcm/){target=\_blank}.

This guide provides an overview of some of the most commonly used XCM instructions, including those in the above example.

## Buy Execution {: #buy-execution }

The [`BuyExecution`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#buyexecution){target=\_blank} instruction typically gets executed in the target chain. It takes assets from the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM), to pay for execution fees. The target chain determines the fees to pay.

## Clear Origin {: #clear-origin }

The [`ClearOrigin`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#clearorigin){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It clears the origin of the XCM author, thereby ensuring that later XCM instructions cannot command the authority of the author.

## Deposit Asset {: #deposit-asset }

The [`DepositAsset`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#depositasset){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It removes the assets from the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM), and sends them to a destination account on the target chain.

## Descend Origin {: #descend-origin }

The [`DescendOrigin`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#descendorigin){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It mutates the origin on the target chain to match the origin on the source chain, ensuring execution on the target chain occurs on behalf of the same entity initiating the XCM message on the source chain.

## Initiate Reserve Withdraw {: #initiate-reserve-withdraw }

The [`InitiateReserveWithdraw`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#initiatereservewithdraw){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the source chain. It removes the assets from the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM), (essentially burning them), and sends an XCM message to the reserve chain starting with the `WithdrawAsset` instruction.

## Refund Surplus {: #refund-surplus }

The [`RefundSurplus`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#refundsurplus){target=\_blank} instruction typically gets executed in the target chain after the XCM is processed. This instruction will take any leftover assets from the `BuyExecution` instruction and put the assets into the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM).

## Reserve Asset Deposited {: #reserve-asset-deposited }

The [`ReserveAssetDeposited`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#reserveassetdeposited-){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It takes a representation of the assets received in the Sovereign account and places them into the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM).

## Set Appendix {: #set-appendix }

The [`SetAppendix`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#setappendix){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It sets the appendix register, which holds code that should be run after the current execution is finished.

## Transfer Reserve Asset {: #transfer-reserve-asset }

The [`TransferReserveAsset`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#transferreserveasset){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the reserve chain. It moves assets from the origin account and deposits them into a destination account on the target chain. It then sends an XCM message to the target chain with the `ReserveAssetDeposited` instruction, followed by the XCM instructions that are to be executed.

## Transact {: #transact }

The [`Transact`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#transact){target=\_blank} instruction gets executed in the target chain. It dispatches encoded call data from a given origin, allowing for the execution of specific operations or functions on the target chain.

## Withdraw Asset {: #withdraw-asset }

The [`WithdrawAsset`](https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format#withdrawasset){target=\_blank} instruction can be executed in either the source or target chain. It removes assets and places them into the holding register, a temporary position in the Cross-Consensus Virtual Machine (XCVM).

# Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Polkadot's architecture](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-architecture/){target=\_blank} allows parachains to natively interoperate with each other, enabling cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset.

To do so, a [Cross-Consensus Message (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank} format defines a language around how the message transfer between two interoperating blockchains should be performed. XCM is not specific to Polkadot, as it aims to be a generic and extensible language between different consensus systems.

This page is a brief introduction and overview of XCM and other related elements. More information can be found in [Polkadot's Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank}.

## General XCM Definitions {: #general-xcm-definitions }

- **XCM** — stands for Cross-Consensus Message. It is a general way for consensus systems to communicate with each other
 - **VMP** — stands for Vertical Message Passing, one of the transport methods for XCMs. It allows parachains to exchange messages with the relay chain. *UMP* (Upward Message Passing) enables parachains to send messages to their relay chain, while *DMP* (Downward Message Passing) enables the relay chain to pass messages down to one of their parachains
 - **XCMP** — stands for Cross-Consensus Message Passing, one of the transport methods for XCMs. It allows parachains to exchange messages with other parachains on the same relay chain
 - **HRMP** — stands for Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing, a stop-gap protocol while a full XCMP implementation is launched. It has the same interface as XCMP, but messages are stored on the relay chain
- **Sovereign account** —  an account each chain in the ecosystem has, one for the relay chain and the other for other parachains. It is calculated as the `blake2` hash of a specific word and parachain ID concatenated (`blake2(para+ParachainID)` for the Sovereign account in the relay chain, and `blake2(sibl+ParachainID)` for the Sovereign account in other parachains), truncating the hash to the correct length. The account is owned by root and can only be used through SUDO (if available) or [governance (referenda)](/learn/features/governance/){target=\_blank}. The Sovereign account typically signs XCM messages in other chains in the ecosystem
 - **Multilocation** —  a way to specify a point in the entire relay chain/parachain ecosystem relative to a given origin. For example, it can be used to specify a specific parachain, asset, account, or even a pallet inside a parachain. In general terms, a multilocation is defined with a `parents` and an `interior`:
 
    - `parents` - refers to how many "hops" into a parent blockchain you need to take from a given origin
    - `interior` - refers to how many fields you need to define the target point. 
    
    For example, to target a parachain with ID `1000` from another parachain, the multilocation would be `{ "parents": 1, "interior": { "X1": [{ "Parachain": 1000 }]}}`

## Cross-Chain Transport Protocols via XCM {: #xcm-transport-protocols }

XCM implements two cross-consensus or transport protocols for acting on XCM messages between its constituent parachains, Moonbeam being one of them:

- **Vertical Message Passing (VMP)** — once a project is onboarded as a parachain, it automatically has a bi-directional communication channel with the relay chain. Therefore, there is no need for chain registration. VMP is divided into two kinds of message-passing transport protocols:

    * **Upward Message Passing (UMP)** — allows parachains to send messages to their relay chain, for example, from Moonbeam to Polkadot
    * **Downward Message Passing (DMP)** — allows the relay chain to pass messages down to one of their parachains, for example, from Polkadot to Moonbeam

- **Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP)** — allows two parachains to exchange messages as long as they are connected to the same relay chain. Cross-chain transactions are resolved using a simple queuing mechanism based on a Merkle tree to ensure fidelity. Collators exchange messages between parachains, while the relay chain validators will verify that the message transmission happened

!!! note
    Currently, while XCMP is being developed, a stop-gap protocol is implemented called Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HRMP), in which the messages are stored in and read from the relay chain. This will be deprecated in the future for the full XCMP implementation.

![Vertical Message Passing and Cross-chain Message Passing Overview](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-1.webp)

## Establishing Cross-Chain Communication {: #channel-registration }

Before two chains can start communicating, a messaging channel must be opened. Channels are unidirectional, meaning that a channel from chain A to chain B will only pass messages from A to B. Therefore, two channels must be opened to send messages back and forth.

A channel for XCMs between the relay chain and parachain is automatically opened when a connection is established. However, when parachain A wants to open a communication channel with parachain B, parachain A must send an open channel extrinsic to its network. This extrinsic is an XCM as well!

Even though parachain A has expressed its intentions of opening an XCM channel with parachain B, the latter has not signaled to the relay chain its intentions to receive messages from parachain A. Therefore, to have an established channel, parachain B must send an extrinsic (an XCM) to the relay chain. The accepting channel extrinsic is similar to the previous one. However, the encoded call data only includes the new method (accept channel) and the parachain ID of the sender (parachain A in this example). Once both parachains have agreed, the channel is opened within the following epoch.

To learn more about the channel registration process, please refer to the [How to Establish an XC Integration with Moonbeam](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc-registration/xc-integration/){target=\_blank} guide.

![XCM Channel Registration Overview](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-2.webp)

Once the channel is established, cross-chain messages can be sent between parachains. For asset transfers, assets need to be registered before being transferred through XCMs, either by being baked into the runtime as a constant or through a pallet. Moonbeam relies on a Substrate pallet to handle asset registration without the need for runtime upgrades, making the process a lot simpler.

To learn how to register an asset on Moonbeam and the information necessary to add Moonbeam assets to another chain, please refer to the [How to Register Cross-Chain Assets](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc-registration/assets/){target=\_blank} guide.

## XCM on Moonbeam {: #moonbeam-and-xcm }

As Moonbeam is a parachain within the Polkadot ecosystems, one of the most direct implementations of XCM is to enable asset transfer from Polkadot and other parachains from/to Moonbeam. This allows users to bring their tokens to Moonbeam and all its dApps.

To this end, Moonbeam has introduced [XC-20s](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/overview/){target=\_blank}, which expand on Moonbeam's unique Ethereum compatibility features. XC-20s allow Polkadot native assets to be represented via a standard [ERC-20 interface](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/balances-erc20/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank} through a precompiled contract. When these assets are registered on Moonbeam, they can be set as XCM execution fee assets. Consequently, when a user transfers such an asset to Moonbeam, a small part of the amount will be used to cover the XCM execution fees.

In addition, ERC-20s that are deployed to Moonbeam can be sent to other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem via XCM. Consequently, from a developer's perspective, XC-20s are ERC-20 tokens with the added benefit of being an XCM cross-chain asset, and dApps can easily support them through a familiar ERC-20 interface.

![Moonbeam XC-20 XCM Integration With Polkadot](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-3.webp)

To send XC-20s across the Polkadot ecosystem from Moonbeam, developers need to use the [Polkadot XCM Pallet](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank} for transfers via the Substrate API and the [X-Tokens Precompile](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xtokens-precompile/){target=\_blank} or the [XCM Precompile](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/eth-api/){target=\_blank} for transfers via the Ethereum API.

Another unique feature of Moonbeam is the ability to initiate XCM actions from EVM smart contracts or to call its EVM through XCM messages via remote execution. This unlocks a new set of possibilities, where contracts on Moonbeam can access parachain-specific functionalities via XCM, or other parachain ecosystems can use EVM smart contracts on Moonbeam to expand their functions.

The following sections provide a high-level overview of the main use cases mentioned before.

### XCM Transfers between Moonbeam & Polkadot {: #transfers-moonbeam-polkadot }

As Moonbeam is a parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem, a straightforward implementation of XCM + VMP is DOT transfers from/to Polkadot/Moonbeam. To this end, DOT was registered as [_xcDOT_](https://moonscan.io/token/0xffffffff1fcacbd218edc0eba20fc2308c778080){target=\_blank} on Moonbeam.

Alice (Polkadot) wants to transfer a certain amount of DOT from Polkadot to her account on Moonbeam, named Alith. Therefore, she initiates an XCM that expresses her intentions. For such transfers, Moonbeam owns a Sovereign account on Polkadot.

Consequently, the XCM message execution on Polkadot will transfer the amount of DOT to Moonbeam's Sovereign account on Polkadot. Once the assets are deposited, the second part of the message is sent to Moonbeam.

Moonbeam will locally execute the action the XCM message is programmed to do. In this case, it is to mint and transfer the same amount of _xcDOT_ to the account defined by Alice, which in this case is Alith. The fee to execute the XCM in the target parachain is paid in the asset being transferred (_xcDOT_ for this example).

![Transfers from the Relay Chain to Moonbeam](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-4.webp)

Note the following:

- The Alice and Alith accounts can be different. For example, Polkadot's accounts are SR25519 (or ED25519), while Moonbeam's are ECDSA (Ethereum-styled) accounts. They can also have different owners
- There is a certain degree of trust where one chain relies on the other to execute its part of the XCM message. This is programmed at a runtime level so that it can be easily verified
- For this example, _xcDOT_ is a wrapped representation of the original DOT being held in Moonbeam's Sovereign account on Polkadot. _xcDOT_ can be transferred within Moonbeam at any time, and they can be redeemed for DOT on a 1:1 basis as well (minus some fees)

Alith deposited her _xcDOT_ in a liquidity pool. Next, Charleth acquires some _xcDOT_ by swapping against that liquidity pool, and he wants to transfer some _xcDOT_ to Charley's Polkadot account. Therefore, he initiates an XCM that expresses his intentions.

Consequently, the XCM message execution on Moonbeam will burn the number of _xcDOT_. Once the assets are burned, the second part of the message is sent to Polkadot.

Polkadot will execute the action the XCM message is programmed to do locally. In this case, it is to transfer the same amount of _xcDOT_ burned from the Moonbeam Sovereign account to the account defined by Charleth, which in this case is Charley.

![Transfers Back from Moonbeam to the Relay Chain](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-5.webp)

### XCM Transfers between Moonbeam & Other Parachains {: #transfers-moonbeam-other-parachains }

Since Moonbeam is a parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem, a straightforward implementation of XCM and XCMP asset transfers from and to Moonbeam and other parachains. This section gives a high-level overview of the main differences compared to XCMs from Polkadot/Moonbeam.

The first requirement is that a bidirectional channel between the parachains must exist, and the asset being transferred must be registered in the target parachain. Only when both conditions are met can XCMs be sent between parachains.

Then, when Alith (Moonbeam) transfers a certain amount of GLMR from Moonbeam to another account (Alice) in a target parachain, tokens are sent to a Sovereign Account owned by that target parachain on Moonbeam.

As the XCM message is executed in the target parachain, it is expected that this will mint and transfer the same amount of _xcGLMR_ (cross-chain GLMR) to the account defined by Alith, which in this case is Alice. The fee to execute the XCM in the target parachain is paid in the transferred asset (_xcGLMR_ for this example).

![Transfers from Moonbeam to another Parachain](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-6.webp)

As explained in the previous section, the process is similar for _xcGLMR_ to move back to Moonbeam. First, the XCM message execution burns the number of _xcGLMR_ returned to Moonbeam. Once burned, the remnant part of the message is sent to Moonbeam via the relay chain. Moonbeam will locally execute the XCM message's and transfer GLMR (the same amount of burned _xcGLMR_) from the target parachain Sovereign account to the specified address.

### Remote Execution between Other Chains & Moonbeam {: #execution-chains-moonbeam }

As mentioned before, XCM also enables remote execution from/to Moonbeam to other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem.

Similarly to the other use cases, it is necessary for XCM-specific channels to be established before remote execution can happen between the chains. Channels are general-purpose, so they can be used for both asset transfers and remote execution.

Another important component is the asset for which the remote execution fees are paid. On Moonbeam, when an XC-20 is registered, it can be set as an XCM execution fee asset. Consequently, when transferring that XC-20 to Moonbeam, the XCM execution fee is deducted from the amount being transferred. For remote execution, users can include a small amount of tokens in the XCM message to cover XCM execution fees.

Alice (Polkadot) wants to perform a certain remote action through a smart contract on Moonbeam. Therefore, she initiates an XCM that expresses her intentions; she must have previously funded the XCM execution account she owns on Moonbeam with either GLMR or _xcDOT_.

Moonbeam will locally execute the action the XCM message is programmed to do. In this case, it is to withdraw the asset decided by Alice for the XCM execution fee and buy some execution time on Moonbeam to execute the smart contract call on Moonbeam's EVM.

You can read more about the flow in detail on the [Remote Execution](/builders/interoperability/xcm/remote-execution/overview/){target=\_blank} page.

# Remote Execution via XCM

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The [Cross-Consensus Message (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank} format defines how messages can be sent between interoperable blockchains. This format opens the door to sending an XCM message that executes an arbitrary set of bytes in a Moonbeam-based network, the relay chain, or other parachains in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystems.

Remote execution via XCM opens a new set of possibilities for cross-chain interactions, from chains executing actions on other chains to users performing remote actions without switching chains.

This page covers the fundamentals of XCM remote execution. If you want to learn how to perform remote execution via XCM, please refer to the [Remote Execution via the Substrate API](/builders/interoperability/xcm/remote-execution/substrate-calls/xcm-transactor-pallet/){target=\_blank} or the [Remote Execution via the Ethereum API](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xtokens-precompile/){target=\_blank} guides.

## Execution Origin {: #execution-origin }

Generally speaking, all transactions have an origin, which is where a call comes from. Ethereum transactions have only one origin type, the `msg.sender`, which is the account that initiated the transaction.

Substrate-based transactions are more complex, as they can have different origins with different privilege levels. This is similar to having an EVM smart contract call with a specific `require` statement in which the call must come from an allowed address. In contrast, these privilege levels are programmed in the Substrate-based runtime itself.

Origins are super important across different components of the Substrate runtime and, hence, the Moonbeam runtime. For example, they define the authority level they inherit in the [on-chain governance implementation](/learn/features/governance/){target=\_blank}.

During the execution of an XCM message, the origin defines the context in which the XCM is being executed. By default, the XCM is executed by the source chain's Sovereign account in the destination chain. This Polkadot-specific property of having remote origins that are calculated when executing XCM is known as [Computed Origins](/builders/interoperability/xcm/remote-execution/computed-origins/){target=\_blank} (formerly known as Multilocation Derivative Accounts).

Depending on the destination chain's configuration, including the `DescendOrigin` XCM instruction can mutate the origin from which the XCM message is executed. This property is significant for remote XCM execution, as the action being executed considers the context of the newly mutated origin and not the source chain's Sovereign account.

## XCM Instructions for Remote Execution {: #xcm-instructions-remote-execution }

The core XCM instructions required to perform remote execution on Moonbeam (as an example) via XCM are the following:

 - [`DescendOrigin`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#descend-origin){target=\_blank} - (optional) gets executed in Moonbeam. Mutates the origin to create a new Computed Origin that represents a keyless account controlled via XCM by the sender in the source chain
 - [`WithdrawAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#withdraw-asset){target=\_blank} - gets executed in Moonbeam. Takes funds from the Computed Origin
 - [`BuyExecution`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#buy-execution){target=\_blank} - gets executed in Moonbeam. Uses the funds taken by the previous XCM instruction to pay for the XCM execution, including the remote call
 - [`Transact`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#transact){target=\_blank} - gets executed in Moonbeam. Executes the arbitrary bytes provided in the XCM instruction

The XCM instructions detailed above can be complemented by other XCM instructions to handle certain scenarios, like failure on execution, more accurately. One example is the inclusion of [`SetAppendix`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#set-appendix){target=\_blank}, [`RefundSurplus`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#refund-surplus){target=\_blank}, and [`Deposit`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#deposit-asset){target=\_blank}.

## General Remote Execution via XCM Flow {: #general-remote-execution-via-xcm-flow }

A user initiates a transaction in the source chain through a pallet that builds the XCM with at least the [required XCM instructions for remote execution](#xcm-instructions-remote-execution). The transaction is executed in the source chain, which sends an XCM message with the given instructions to the destination chain.

The XCM message arrives at the destination chain, which executes it. It is executed with the source chain's Sovereign account as a Computed Origin by default. One example that uses this type of origin is when chains open or accept an HRMP channel on the relay chain.

If the XCM message included a [`DescendOrigin`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#descend-origin){target=\_blank} instruction, the destination chain may mutate the origin to calculate a new Computed Origin (as is the case with Moonbeam-based networks).

Next, [`WithdrawAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#withdraw-asset){target=\_blank} takes funds from the Computed Origin (either a Sovereign account or mutated), which are then used to pay for the XCM execution through the [`BuyExecution`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#buy-execution){target=\_blank} XCM instruction. Note that on both instructions, you need to specify which asset you want to use. In addition, you must include the bytes to be executed in the amount of execution to buy.

Lastly, [`Transact`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#transact){target=\_blank} executes an arbitrary set of bytes that correspond to a pallet and function in the destination chain. You have to specify the type of origin to use (typically `SovereignAccount`) and the weight required to execute the bytes (similar to gas in the Ethereum realm).

# Overview of XC-20s

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The [Cross-Consensus Message (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank} format provides a universal way for blockchains to exchange messages and transfer assets. To extend this interoperability to the EVM, Moonbeam introduced XC-20s, ERC-20 tokens on Moonbeam that are fully compatible with XCM transfers.

Any ERC-20 deployed on Moonbeam can be configured as an XC-20, making it accessible to any chain connected via XCM. This allows EVM-focused developers to work with familiar ERC-20 workflows while benefiting from Polkadot’s native cross-chain functionality, all without needing Substrate-specific expertise.

From a technical standpoint, local XC-20s are ERC-20 tokens originating on Moonbeam (including bridged tokens deemed native once issued on Moonbeam), whereas external XC-20s are wrapped representations of tokens whose canonical ledger exists on another parachain or the relay chain. In all cases, XC-20s function just like standard ERC-20s—supporting common EVM-based use cases (such as DeFi, DEXs, and lending platforms)—but with the added advantage of seamless cross-chain operability.

![Moonbeam XC-20 XCM Integration With Polkadot](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/overview/overview-3.webp)

This page aims to cover the basics on XC-20s; if you want to learn how to interact with or transfer XC-20s, please refer to the [Send XC-20s guide](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/overview/){target=\_blank}.

## Types of XC-20s {: #types-of-xc-20s }

There are two types of XC-20s: local and external.

### What are Local XC-20s? {: #local-xc20s }

Local XC-20s are all ERC-20s that exist on the EVM, and that can be transferred cross-chain through XCM. For local XC-20s to be transferred to another parachain, the asset must be registered on that chain. When transferring local XC-20s, the underlying tokens reside in the destination chain's Sovereign account on Moonbeam. A [sovereign account](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/sovereign-accounts/){target=\_blank} is a keyless account governed by a blockchain runtime—rather than an individual—that can hold assets and interact with other chains. Local XC-20s must follow [the ERC-20 interface outlined in this guide](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/interact/#the-erc20-interface){target=\_blank}. They must implement the standard ERC-20 function signatures, including the correct function selector of the `transfer` function as described in [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank}. However, additional functionality can still be added as long as it doesn’t break the base methods. 

Creating a local XC-20 is equivalent to deploying a standard ERC-20 and enabling cross-chain features on any Moonbeam network.

### What are External XC-20s? {: #external-xc20s }

External XC-20s are cross-chain tokens originating from another parachain or the relay chain, and they are represented on Moonbeam as ERC-20 tokens. The original tokens remain locked in a Moonbeam sovereign account on their home chain, while the wrapped ERC-20 representation can be freely utilized on Moonbeam. When you transfer external XC-20s, the canonical assets remain in the sovereign account on their source chain, while the ERC-20 representation is what circulates on Moonbeam.

External XC-20s all have _xc_ prepended to their names to distinguish them as cross-chain assets. For example, DOT, native to the Polkadot relay chain, is known as xcDOT when represented as an XC-20 on Moonbeam.

### Local XC-20s vs External XC-20s {: #local-xc-20s-vs-external-xc-20s }

Local XC-20s are EVM-native ERC-20 tokens whose “home” (or reserve chain) is Moonbeam from a Polkadot perspective. This includes tokens originally bridged in from outside Polkadot (for example, Wormhole-wrapped ETH), because once they’re issued on Moonbeam as ERC-20s, Polkadot views them as local to Moonbeam. When local XC-20s are transferred to another parachain, the tokens move into that chain’s sovereign account on Moonbeam.

External XC-20s, on the other hand, are ERC-20 representations of tokens whose canonical ledger remains on another parachain or the relay chain. Moonbeam holds the “wrapped” version, while the underlying tokens stay locked in Moonbeam’s sovereign account on the originating chain.

From a cross-chain transfer perspective, local and external XC-20s can be sent through Polkadot’s XCM infrastructure using the Ethereum or Substrate API. Because the underlying asset is an ERC-20 with EVM bytecode following the [EIP-20 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank}, both transfers initiated via the Substrate and Ehereum APIs generate EVM logs visible to EVM-based explorers such as [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank}. In contrast, you can't send a regular ERC-20 transfer using the Substrate API. Aside from cross-chain transfers through XCM, all other XC-20 interactions (such as querying balances or adjusting allowances) must occur in the EVM.

Cross-chain transfers of XC-20s are executed via the Polkadot XCM Pallet, which utilizes regular mint, burn, and transfer mechanisms of ERC-20s for the XCM asset flow. If you’d like to learn how to send XC-20s using that pallet, refer to the [Using the Polkadot XCM Pallet](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank} guide.

## Asset Reserves {: #asset-reserves }

When transferring tokens across chains in the Polkadot or Kusama ecosystems, each token has a “reserve” chain that holds its canonical ledger—the source of truth for minting, burning, and supply management. For XC-20s, understanding which chain is the reserve determines whether the asset is managed locally on Moonbeam or remotely on another chain.

Regardless of where the reserve is located, XC-20s on Moonbeam are still ERC-20 tokens that developers and users can interact with in the EVM. However, from an XCM perspective, the reserve chain determines how the tokens are locked, unlocked, minted, or burned behind the scenes when performing cross-chain operations.

### Local Reserve Assets {: #local-reserve-assets }

A local reserve asset on Moonbeam is a token whose canonical ledger—from an XCM perspective—resides natively on Moonbeam. In other words, Moonbeam is the asset’s home chain, where minting and burning take place. 

For example, Wormhole-wrapped ETH (wETH) is considered a local reserve asset on Moonbeam, even though Ethereum is the ultimate source of ETH. Once ETH is wrapped by Wormhole and enters the Polkadot ecosystem via Moonbeam, wETH can be transferred to other parachains through [Moonbeam Routed Liquidity (MRL)](/builders/interoperability/mrl/){target=\_blank}.

The important caveat is that, on a purely Ethereum-level view, ETH remains governed by and minted on Ethereum. However, from an XCM standpoint, wETH on Moonbeam is treated as a local reserve asset, meaning the canonical supply of wETH (as far as Polkadot ecosystems are concerned) exists on Moonbeam.

### Remote Reserve Assets {: #remote-reserve-assets }

A remote reserve asset is a token whose canonical ledger—the source of truth for minting and burning—resides on a chain different from where it’s currently in use. In the case of xcDOT on Moonbeam, the underlying DOT tokens representing the xcDOT remain locked in Moonbeam’s sovereign account on the Polkadot relay chain, while xcDOT functions as a wrapped representation in Moonbeam’s EVM environment.

Users can hold and transact with xcDOT on Moonbeam (for DeFi, governance, and more), knowing that the underlying DOT is safely locked on the relay chain. At any point, the wrapped xcDOT can be redeemed for the original DOT, effectively burning the xcDOT and unlocking the corresponding DOT tokens on Polkadot.

### Retrieve List of External XC-20s and Their Metadata {: #list-xchain-assets }

To fetch a list of the currently available external XC-20s along with their associated metadata, you can query the chain state using the [Polkadot.js API](/builders/substrate/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}. You'll take the following steps:

1. Create an API provider for the network you'd like to get the list of assets for. You can use the following WSS endpoints for each network:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```text
        wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```text
        wss://wss.api.moonriver.moonbeam.network
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```text
        {{ networks.moonbase.wss_url }}
        ```

2. Query the `assets` pallet for all assets
3. Iterate over the list of assets to get all of the asset IDs along with their associated metadata

```js
import { ApiPromise, WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';

const getXc20s = async () => {
  try {
    const substrateProvider = new WsProvider('INSERT_WSS_ENDPOINT');
    const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: substrateProvider });

    const assets = await api.query.assets.asset.entries();

    await Promise.all(
      assets.map(async ([{ args: [id] }]) => {
        try {
          const metadata = await api.query.assets.metadata(id);
          const humanMetadata = metadata.toHuman();
          
          console.log(`\nAsset ID: ${id}`);
          console.log('Metadata:');
          console.log('  Name:', humanMetadata.name);
          console.log('  Symbol:', humanMetadata.symbol);
          console.log('  Decimals:', humanMetadata.decimals);
          console.log('  Deposit:', humanMetadata.deposit);
          console.log('  IsFrozen:', humanMetadata.isFrozen);
          console.log('-----');
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Error fetching metadata for asset ${id}:`, error);
        }
      })
    );

    await api.disconnect();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in getXc20s:', error);
  }
};

getXc20s().catch(console.error);
```

The result will display the asset ID along with some additional information for all of the registered external XC-20s.

## Retrieve Local XC-20 Metadata {: #retrieve-local-xc20-metadata }

Since local XC-20s are ERC-20s on Moonbeam that can be transferred via XCM to another parachain, you can interact with local XC-20s like you would an ERC-20. As long as you have the address and the ABI of the ERC-20, you can retrieve its metadata by interacting with its ERC-20 interface to retrieve the name, symbol, and decimals for the asset.

The following is an example that retrieves the asset metadata for the [Jupiter token](https://moonbase.moonscan.io/token/0x9aac6fb41773af877a2be73c99897f3ddfacf576){target=\_blank} on Moonbase Alpha:

    chainId: 1287, // 0x507 in hex,
  },
};

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerRPC.moonbase.rpc, {
  chainId: providerRPC.moonbase.chainId,
  name: providerRPC.moonbase.name,
});

// Replace with the address of the ERC-20 token

const tokenABI = [
  'function name() view returns (string)',
  'function symbol() view returns (string)',
  'function decimals() view returns (uint8)',
];

const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, tokenABI, provider);
async function getTokenMetadata() {
  try {
    const [name, symbol, decimals] = await Promise.all([
      tokenContract.name(),
      tokenContract.symbol(),
      tokenContract.decimals(),
    ]);
    console.log(`Name: ${name}`);
    console.log(`Symbol: ${symbol}`);
    console.log(`Decimals: ${decimals}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching token metadata:', error);
  }
}
getTokenMetadata();
    ```

const tokenContract = new web3.eth.Contract(tokenABI, tokenAddress);

# Overview of XC-20 Transfers

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Assets can move between parachains using XCM. Two main approaches exist:

- **Asset teleporting** – destroys tokens on the reserve chain and mints the same amount on the destination chain. Each chain holds the native asset as a reserve, similar to a burn-mint bridging mechanism. Because each chain can create tokens, a degree of trust is required
- **Remote transfers** – moves tokens from the reserve chain to a Sovereign account (an account on the reserve chain trustlessly controlled by the destination chain). The destination chain then mints a wrapped (also called “virtual” or “cross-chain”) representation. This wrapped version is always interchangeable 1:1 with the original asset, functioning like a lock-mint and burn-unlock bridge. The chain where the asset originates is known as the reserve chain

![Asset Teleporting and Remote Transfers](/images/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/overview/overview-1.webp)

Moonbeam currently uses remote transfers for XC-20 transfers.

This page covers the fundamentals of XCM-based remote transfers. To learn how to perform XC-20 transfers, refer to the the [XC-20 transfers via the Substrate API](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank} guide.

## XCM Instructions for Asset Transfers {: #xcm-instructions-for-asset-transfers }

The XCM Pallet and Precompile abstract much of the complexity involved in cross-chain asset transfers, automatically constructing the necessary XCM messages. Nevertheless, having a basic understanding of the underlying instructions can be useful. 

For reference, you can find the Polkadot XCM Pallet extrinsics for sending XC-20s in the [Using the Polkadot XCM Pallet To Send XC-20s guide](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=_blank}.

The instructions in each XCM transfer vary depending on the asset and the transfer route. For example, returning a native token like xcDOT to its reserve chain (from Moonbeam to Polkadot) differs from sending DOT from Polkadot to Moonbeam. Below are examples of the instructions commonly involved in these token transfers.

### Instructions to Transfer a Reserve Asset from the Reserve Chain {: #transfer-native-from-origin }

When DOT is transferred from Polkadot to Moonbeam, the following XCM instructions are executed in sequence:

1. [`TransferReserveAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#transfer-reserve-asset){target=_blank} - executes on Polkadot, moving the DOT from the sender and depositing it into Moonbeam’s Sovereign account on Polkadot

2. [`ReserveAssetDeposited`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#reserve-asset-deposited){target=_blank} - executes on Moonbeam, minting the corresponding ERC-20 representation of DOT (xcDOT) on Moonbeam

3. [`ClearOrigin`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#clear-origin){target=_blank} - executes on Moonbeam, clearing any origin data—previously set to Polkadot’s Sovereign account

4. [`BuyExecution`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#buy-execution){target=_blank} - executes on Moonbeam, determining the execution fees. Here, a portion of the newly minted xcDOT is used to pay the cost of XCM

5. [`DepositAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#deposit-asset){target=_blank} - executes on Moonbeam, delivering the xcDOT to the intended recipient’s account on Moonbeam

This process invokes `TransferReserveAsset` with `assets`, `dest`, and `xcm`parameters. Within the `xcm` parameter, you typically specify the `BuyExecution` and `DepositAsset` instructions. As shown in the [`TransferReserveAsset` instruction](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/{{ polkadot_sdk }}/polkadot/xcm/xcm-executor/src/lib.rs#L630){target=\_blank}, the flow also includes `ReserveAssetDeposited` and `ClearOrigin` to complete the transfer.

For more information on constructing an XCM message for asset transfers, such as DOT to Moonbeam, refer to the [Polkadot XCM Pallet guide](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=\_blank}.

### Instructions to Transfer a Reserve Asset back to the Reserve Chain {: #transfer-native-to-origin }

In scenarios where you want to move an asset back to its reserve chain, such as sending xcDOT from Moonbeam to Polkadot, Moonbeam uses the following set of XCM instructions:

1. [`WithdrawAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#withdraw-asset){target=_blank} – executes on Moonbeam, taking the specified token (xcDOT) from the sender

2. [`InitiateReserveWithdraw`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#initiate-reserve-withdraw){target=_blank} – executes on Moonbeam, which, burns the token on Moonbeam (removing the wrapped representation), and sends an XCM message to Polkadot, indicating the tokens should be released there 

3. [`WithdrawAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#withdraw-asset){target=_blank} – executes on Polkadot, removing the tokens from Moonbeam’s Sovereign account on Polkadot

4. [`ClearOrigin`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#clear-origin){target=_blank} – gets executed on Polkadot. Clears any origin data (e.g., the Sovereign account on Moonbeam)

5. [`BuyExecution`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#buy-execution){target=_blank} – Polkadot determines the execution fees and uses part of the DOT being transferred to pay for them

6. [`DepositAsset`](/builders/interoperability/xcm/core-concepts/instructions/#deposit-asset){target=_blank} – finally, the native DOT tokens are deposited into the specified Polkadot account

Steps 3 through 6 are automatically triggered by the `InitiateReserveWithdraw` instruction (step 2) and execute on Polkadot. Once `InitiateReserveWithdraw` is invoked on Moonbeam, the assembled XCM message instructs Polkadot to run those final instructions, completing the cross-chain transfer. In other words, while Moonbeam constructs the XCM instructions behind the scenes, they ultimately execute on Polkadot to complete the asset’s return to its reserve chain.

For more information on constructing an XCM message to transfer reserve assets to a target chain, such as xcDOT to Polkadot, you refer to the guide to the [Polkadot XCM Pallet](/builders/interoperability/xcm/xc20/send-xc20s/xcm-pallet/){target=_blank}.

!!! note
	The specific instructions may vary over time, but this overall flow remains consistent: the tokens are withdrawn from the user on Moonbeam, burned from the local representation, and unlocked on the reserve chain. At the end of the process, they become fully accessible again on their reserve chain.

# Run a Collator on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Collators are members of the network that maintain the parachains they take part in. They run a full node (for both their particular parachain and the relay chain), and they produce the state transition proof for relay chain validators.

There are some [requirements](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/){target=\_blank} that need to be considered prior to becoming a collator candidate including machine, bonding, account, and community requirements.

Candidates will need a minimum amount of tokens bonded (self-bonded) to be considered eligible. Only a certain number of the top collator candidates by total stake, including self-bonded and delegated stake, will be in the active set of collators. Otherwise, the collator will remain in the candidate pool.

Once a candidate is selected to be in the active set of collators, they are eligible to produce blocks.

Moonbeam uses the Nimbus Parachain Consensus Framework. This provides a two-step filter to allocate candidates to the active set of collators, then assign collators to a block production slot:

 - The parachain staking filter selects the top candidates in terms of tokens staked in each network. For the exact number of top candidates per each network and the minimum bond amount, you can check out the [Minimum Collator Bond](/node-operators/networks/collators/requirements/#minimum-collator-bond){target=\_blank} section of our documentation. This filtered pool is called selected candidates (also known as the active set), which are rotated every round
 - The fixed size subset filter picks a pseudo-random subset of the previously selected candidates for each block production slot

Users can spin up full nodes on Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha and activate the `collate` feature to participate in the ecosystem as collator candidates. To do this, you can checkout the [Run a Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/){target=\_blank} section of the documentation and spin up a node using either [Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/){target=\_blank} or [Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/){target=\_blank}.

## Join the Discord {: #join-discord }

As a collator, it is important to keep track of updates and changes to configuration. It is also important to be able to easily contact us and vice versa in case there is any issue with your node, as that will not only negatively affect collator and delegator rewards, it will also negatively affect the network.

For this purpose, we use [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/moonbeam){target=\_blank}. The most relevant Discord channels for collators are the following:

 - **tech-upgrades-announcements** — here we will publish any updates or changes in configuration changes collators will be required to follow. We will also announce any technical issues to monitor, such as network stalls
 - **collators** — this is the general collator discussion channel. We are proud of having an active and friendly collator community so if you have any questions, this is the place to ask. We will also ping collators here for any issues that require their attention.
 - **meet-the-collators** — in this channel you can introduce yourself to potential delegators

After you join Discord, feel free to DM *gilmouta* or *artkaseman* and introduce yourself. This will help the team identify who to contact if issues arise with your node and will enable assignment of the relevant Discord collator role, allowing you to post in *meet-the-collators*.

# Run a Node on Moonbeam

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Running a full node on a Moonbeam-based network allows you to connect to the network, sync with a bootnode, obtain local access to RPC endpoints, author blocks on the parachain, and more.

There are multiple deployments of Moonbeam, including the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, Moonriver on Kusama, and Moonbeam on Polkadot. Here's how these environments are named and their corresponding [chain specification file](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/deployment/generate-chain-specs/) names:

|    Network     |      Hosted By      |             Chain Name              |
|:--------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| Moonbase Alpha | Moonbeam Foundation | {{ networks.moonbase.chain_spec }}  |
|   Moonriver    |       Kusama        | {{ networks.moonriver.chain_spec }} |
|    Moonbeam    |      Polkadot       | {{ networks.moonbeam.chain_spec }}  |

!!! note
    Moonbase Alpha is still considered an Alphanet, and as such _will not_ have 100% uptime. The parachain might be purged as needed. During the development of your application, make sure you implement a method to redeploy your contracts and accounts to a fresh parachain quickly. If a chain purge is required, it will be announced via our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX) at least 24 hours in advance.

## Requirements {: #requirements }

Running a parachain node is similar to a typical Substrate node, but there are some differences. A Substrate parachain node is a bigger build because it contains code to run the parachain itself, as well as code to sync the relay chain and facilitate communication between the two. As such, this build is quite large and may take over 30 min and require 32GB of memory.

The minimum specs recommended to run a node are shown in the following table. For our Kusama and Polkadot MainNet deployments, disk requirements will be higher as the network grows.

!!! note
    If you don't see an `Imported` message (without the `[Relaychain]` tag) when running a node, you might need to double-check your port configuration.

## Running Ports {: #running-ports }

As stated before, the relay/parachain nodes will listen on multiple ports. The default Substrate ports are used in the parachain, while the relay chain will listen on the next higher port.

The only ports that need to be open for incoming traffic are those designated for P2P. **Collators must not have RPC or WS ports opened**.

!!! note
    As of client v0.33.0, the `--ws-port` and `--ws-max-connections` flags have been deprecated and removed in favor of the `--rpc-port` and `--rpc-max-connections` flags for both RPC and WSS connections. The default port is `9944`, and the default maximum number of connections is set to 100.

### Default Ports for a Parachain Full-Node {: #default-ports-for-a-parachain-full-node }

|  Description   |                Port                 |
|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
|    **P2P**     | {{ networks.parachain.p2p }} (TCP)  |
|  **RPC & WS**  |     {{ networks.parachain.ws }}     |
| **Prometheus** | {{ networks.parachain.prometheus }} |

### Default Ports of Embedded Relay Chain {: #default-ports-of-embedded-relay-chain }

|  Description   |                 Port                  |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|    **P2P**     | {{ networks.relay_chain.p2p }} (TCP)  |
|  **RPC & WS**  |     {{ networks.relay_chain.ws }}     |
| **Prometheus** | {{ networks.relay_chain.prometheus }} |

## Installation {: #installation }

There are a couple different guides to help you get started running a Moonbeam-based node:

- [Using Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/) - this method provides a quick and easy way to get started with a Docker container
- [Using Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/) - this method is recommended for those with experience compiling a Substrate node

## Debug, Trace and TxPool APIs {: #debug-trace-txpool-apis }

You can also gain access to some non-standard RPC methods by running a tracing node, which allow developers to inspect and debug transactions during runtime. Tracing nodes use a different Docker image than a standard Moonbase Alpha, Moonriver, or Moonbeam node. Check out the [Run a Tracing Node](/node-operators/networks/tracing-node/) guide and be sure to switch to the right network tab throughout the instructions. Then to interact with your tracing node, check out the [Debug & Trace](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/) guide.

## Lazy Loading {: #lazy-loading }

Lazy loading lets a Moonbeam node operate while downloading network state in the background, eliminating the need to wait for full synchronization before use. You can activate lazy loading with the following flag:

- **`--lazy-loading-remote-rpc`** - allows lazy loading by relying on a specified RPC for network state until the node is fully synchronized e.g. `--lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT-RPC-URL'`

Upon spooling up a node with this feature, you'll see output like the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty>[Lazy loading 🌗]
    <br>You are now running the Moonbeam client in lazy loading mode, where data is retrieved
    <br>from a live RPC node on demand.
    <br>Using remote state from: https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com
    <br>Forking from block: 8482853
    <br>To ensure the client works properly, please note the following:
    <br>    1. *Avoid Throttling*: Ensure that the backing RPC node is not limiting the number of
    <br>    requests, as this can prevent the lazy loading client from functioning correctly;
    <br>    2. *Be Patient*: As the client may take approximately 20 times longer than normal to
    <br>    retrieve and process the necessary data for the requested operation.
    <br>The service will start in 10 seconds...</span>
</div>

!!! note
    Lazy loading a Moonbeam requires a large number of RPC requests. To avoid being rate-limited by a public endpoint, it's highly recommended to use a [dedicated endpoint](/builders/get-started/endpoints#endpoint-providers).  

You can further customize your use of the lazy loading functionality with the following optional parameters:

- **`--lazy-loading-block`** - specifies a block hash from which to start loading data. If not provided, the latest block will be used
- **`--lazy-loading-delay-between-requests`** - the delay (in milliseconds) between RPC requests when using lazy loading. This parameter controls the amount of time to wait between consecutive RPC requests. This can help manage request rate and avoid overwhelming the server. Default value is `100` milliseconds
- **`--lazy-loading-max-retries-per-request`** - the maximum number of retries for an RPC request when using lazy loading. Default value is `10` retries
- **`--lazy-loading-runtime-override`** - path to a WASM file to override the runtime when forking. If not provided, it will fetch the runtime from the block being forked
- **`--lazy-loading-state-overrides`** - path to a JSON file containing state overrides to be applied when forking 

The state overrides file should define the respective pallet, storage item, and value that you seek to override as follows:

```json
[
 {
     "pallet": "System",
     "storage": "SelectedCandidates",
     "value": "0x04f24ff3a9cf04c71dbc94d0b566f7a27b94566cac"
 }
]
```

## Logs and Troubleshooting {: #logs-and-troubleshooting }

You will see logs from both the relay chain and the parachain. The relay chain will be prefixed by `[Relaychain]`, while the parachain has no prefix.

### P2P Ports Not Open {: #p2p-ports-not-open }

If you don't see an `Imported` message (without the `[Relaychain]` tag), you need to check the P2P port configuration. P2P port must be open to incoming traffic.

### In Sync {: #in-sync }

Both chains must be in sync at all times, and you should see either `Imported` or `Idle` messages and have connected peers.

### Genesis Mismatching {: #genesis-mismatching }

The Moonbase Alpha TestNet may need to be purged and upgraded once in a while. Consequently, you may see the following message:

```text
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id `ID` is on a different
chain (our genesis: GENESIS_ID theirs: OTHER_GENESIS_ID)
```

This typically means that you are running an older version and will need to upgrade.

We announce the upgrades (and corresponding chain purge) via our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX) at least 24 hours in advance.

Instructions for purging chain data will vary slightly depending on how you spun up your node:

  - For Docker, you can check out the [Purge Your Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/#purge-your-node) section of the [Using Docker](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/docker/) page
  - For Systemd, you can take a look at the [Purge Your Node](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#purge-your-node) section of the [Using Systemd](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/) page

# Glossary

There's a great deal of terminology that's specific to Polkadot, Substrate, and the emerging Parity/Web3 ecosystem. We've compiled a list of terms we think you'll want to know as you review the Moonbeam documentation, plans, and tutorials.

### Collators {: #collators }

One of the key network participants needed to support parachains within the Polkadot Network. In Moonbeam, collators are the nodes that are responsible for block production and for submitting produced blocks up to the Polkadot relay chain for finalization.

### Delegators {: #delegators }

Moonbeam token holders who stake tokens, vouching for specific collator candidates on the parachain. Any user that holds a minimum amount of tokens as [free balance](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-accounts/#balance-types#balance-types){target=\_blank} can become a delegator by staking their tokens.

### Nominators {: #nominators }

Relay chain token holders who select to "back" a validator. They can receive part of the validator's reward, but are subject to slashing of their staked tokens in case the validator misbehaves. A nominator can back up to 16 validators, and their bond is fully distributed between the backed validators that were selected for the validator set.

### Nominated Proof of Stake {: #nominated-proof-of-stake }

The mechanism used by Polkadot for selecting its block validator set to maximize chain security. At its core, it is a Proof-of-Stake system (PoS) in which nominators back validators. The latter with the highest backing are selected to be part of the validator set for a session. The stake of a validator is slashed in case of misbehavior. Thus, nominators are expected to do due diligence on the validators they nominate.

### Parachains {: #parachains }

A blockchain which has a slot and is connected to Polkadot. Parachains receive shared security from Polkadot and the ability to interact with other parachains on the Polkadot network. They must lock DOT, the native relay chain token, to secure a slot for a specific period (up two years).

### Parathreads {: #parathreads }

A blockchain which can connect to Polkadot. Parathreads are able to interact with other members of the Polkadot network, but they bid for block finalization (in DOT) on a block-to-block basis. They compete with other parathreads for block finalization, meaning that the block with the highest bid is selected to be finalize in that round.

### Polkadot {: #polkadot }

A network of connected blockchains that provides shared security and the ability to interact between chains. Polkadot is built using the Substrate development framework. Chains that connect to Polkadot are called parachains.

### Relay Chain {: #relay-chain }

The backbone blockchain supporting the Polkadot network. Parachains connect to the relay chain and use it for shared security and message passing. Validators on the relay chain help secure the parachains.

### Smart Contract {: #smart-contract }

A [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract){target=\_blank} is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control, or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. Smart contracts intend to reduce the need for trusted intermediators, arbitrations, and enforcement costs, as well as reduce fraud losses and malicious and accidental exceptions.

### Substrate {: #substrate }

A Rust-based blockchain development framework created by Parity Technologies based on their experience implementing multiple blockchain clients. Substrate comes with many modules and functionalities that are needed when building a blockchain, including P2P networking, consensus mechanisms, staking, cryptocurrency, on-chain governance modules, and more. It dramatically reduces the time and engineering effort required to implement a blockchain. Substrate is now part of the [Polkadot SDK](https://polkadot.com/platform/sdk/){target=\_blank}.

### Substrate Frame Pallets {: #substrate-frame-pallets }

Substrate Frame Pallets are a collection of Rust-based modules, providing the functionality required for building a blockchain.

### Validators {: #validators }

A node that secures the Polkadot relay chain by staking DOT in the network, which is slashed if they misbehave. They finalize blocks from collators on parachains and also participate on consensus for the next relay chain block with other validators.

### WebAssembly/Wasm {: #webassemblywasm }

WebAssembly is an open standard that defines a portable binary code format. It is supported by different programming languages, compilers, and browsers.

# How to List your Project on the Moonbeam DApp Directory

## Introduction to the Moonbeam DApp Directory {: #introduction-to-state-of-the-dapps }

The Moonbeam ecosystem comprises two distinct production networks: Moonbeam and Moonriver. Each network has its own dedicated DApp Directory, maintained by the Moonbeam Foundation: [Moonbeam](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbeam/app-dir){target=\_blank} and [Moonriver](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonriver/app-dir){target=\_blank}. These directories categorize projects spanning from DeFi to NFTs to gaming, providing users with comprehensive access to diverse applications.

You'll supply core project details like name, description, and relevant links when adding your project. Depending on your project type, you may include additional data such as on-chain stats and token information.

Despite the distinction between the Moonbeam and Moonriver DApp directories, the submission process remains the same. To list your project on the DApp Directory, you must submit a pull request to the [Moonbeam Foundation's App Directory Data repository on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank}. This guide outlines the necessary data and formatting specifics for your submission.

![The Moonbeam DApp Directory home page](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-1.webp)

## Overview of the Project Data {: #overview-project-data }

There are four main sources of data that are used for a project's listing in the Moonbeam DApp Directory:

- **Core project data**: Core project data such as descriptions, logos, and screenshots. This data also includes IDs used to query data from external platforms.
- **Active users and transaction volume**: On-chain data based on smart contract activity for all of the contracts associated with the project. Data is discovered via the use of contract labeling in Moonscan and is indexed and consumed by the DApp Directory.
- **TVL data**: TVL data for the protocol, sourced from the project's listing on DefiLlama.
- **Project token information**: Token information, which is sourced from the project's listing on CoinGecko.

## Prerequisites for Using External Data Sources {: #configuring-external-data-sources }

Before pulling data from the mentioned sources, certain prerequisites must be fulfilled. However, it's worth noting that these steps may not apply to all project types. For instance, in the case of wallets, where there are no smart contracts, the DApp Directory is currently unable to display user and transaction activity data.

### Configure the Data Source for Active Users and Transaction Volume {: #configure-active-users }

For projects that have smart contracts deployed on Moonbeam or Moonriver, it is important that those contracts can be linked to the DApp Directory project data.

The end-to-end flow for linking smart contract activity to the DApp Directory is as follows:

1. The smart contract owner fills in the [form to label contracts on Moonscan](https://moonscan.io/contactus?id=5){target=\_blank}.
2. The contracts become labeled in Moonscan.
3. Labeled contracts can then be ingested by ecosystem analytics providers to index activity for your project.
4. (Recommended) Register your project with FiDi so your activity can be indexed and publicly viewable. See the FiDi registration section below.

To get your project's smart contracts properly labeled on [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank}, submit the [Moonscan contract labeling form](https://moonscan.io/contactus?id=5){target=\_blank} with your project and contract details.

### Register with FiDi for Analytics (Recommended) {: #register-with-fidi }

New and existing projects are encouraged to register with FiDi so your project's activity can be indexed and surfaced in public analytics. Submit your project using the [FiDi Project Listing Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8c5iOzwIHhLJKRTnC48j7CAj9JY8i_lHxryNBdJdzIyDx3Q/viewform){target=\_blank}.

After submission, Moonbeam FiDi analytics can be viewed on the [Moonbeam FiDi Dashboard](https://moonbeam.fidi.tech/dashboard/moonbeam){target=\_blank}.

Required Project Information:

Where possible, include a short purpose description for each contract to improve completeness.

- **Core smart contracts**: Addresses of main contracts that define core functionality and interact significantly with the network. Optionally, include a brief description of each contract's purpose.
- **Factory contracts**: If applicable, addresses of any contracts that deploy other contracts as part of your dApp. Please also provide the creation topic (hash of the creation event) for each factory contract.
- **Deployer wallets**: If applicable, addresses of wallets used to deploy your project's contracts.

Additional Project-Specific Information (Optional):

- **Treasury/Admin wallets**: Addresses of wallets with administrative control or funds. Optionally, include a brief description of each wallet's function.
- **Oracle contracts**: Addresses of any oracle contracts. Optionally, include a brief description of what data these oracles provide.
- **Bridge contracts**: Addresses of any bridge contracts and the list of connected chains.
- **Governance contracts**: Addresses of any contracts related to on-chain governance. Optionally, include a brief explanation of your governance model.

Additional considerations:

- If your project batches transactions, consider using the Batch Precompile.
- Factory contracts should derive from or mimic the standard Uniswap factory.
- Diamond (multi-facet proxy) contracts are supported and will be indexed correctly.
- Typical listing time is 1–2 weeks; FiDi may reach out for clarifications.

Once you've labeled your smart contracts and are ready to submit your project to the DApp Directory, configuring the Directory to utilize your smart contract data becomes straightforward. You'll only need the **Project** component of your labeled contracts.

Consider the following example project with two smart contracts: a Comptroller and a Router recently updated to a new version.

|  Project   | Contract Name | Contract Version |      Resulting Label       |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------------:|
| My Project |  Comptroller  |        V1        | My Project: Comptroller V1 |
| My Project |    Router     |        V2        |   My Project: Router V2    |

To submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, ensure you have your **Project** name ready, identified here as `My Project`.

If you're ready to add your project to the DApp Directory, skip to the [How to Submit Your Project Listing](#how-to-submit-your-project-listing) section.

### Configure the Data Source for TVL {: #configure-tvl }

If the project represents a DeFi protocol with TVL (whereby value is locked in the protocol's smart contract), it is possible to display TVL in the Moonbeam DApp Directory.

TVL data is pulled from [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com){target=\_blank}, so you must list your project there. To get your project listed, please refer to DefiLlama's documentation on [How to list a DeFi project](https://docs.llama.fi/list-your-project/submit-a-project){target=\_blank}.

After listing your project, you can easily configure the DApp Directory to pull data from DefiLlama. To do so, you'll need the DefiLlama identifier, which you can find in the URL for your protocol's page. For example, the URL for Moonwell's page is `https://defillama.com/protocol/moonwell`, so the identifier is `moonwell`.

If you have the identifier and are ready to submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, skip to the [How to Submit Your Project Listing](#how-to-submit-your-project-listing) section.

### Configure the Data Source for Project Token Information {: #project-token-information }

If a project has a token, it is possible to display the name of the token, current price, and contract in the DApp Directory.

However, the data is pulled from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com){target=\_blank}, so the project's token must be listed there. If your token is not listed there, you can complete [CoinGecko's Request Form](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/requests/new){target=\_blank} to initiate the listing process.

Assuming your project's token is listed there, you must obtain the CoinGecko **API ID** value. You can find the **API ID** value in the **Information** section of the token's page on CoinGecko. For example, the **API ID** on [Moonwell's token page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonwell){target=\_blank} is `moonwell-artemis`.

If you have the CoinGecko ID and are ready to submit your project to the Moonbeam DApp Directory, you can continue to the next section.

## How to Submit Your Project Listing {: #how-to-submit-your-project-listing }

As mentioned, you must submit a pull request to the Moonbeam Foundation's GitHub repository that holds the DApp Directory's data. Before getting started, it's worth noting that to expedite the review process, the GitHub user who submits the pull request is recommended to be a major contributor to the project's GitHub so that the Moonbeam Foundation can quickly verify that they represent the project. You can check out the [Review Process](#review-process) section for more information.

To begin, you have two options for adding your project information to the [`app-directory-data` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank}. You can utilize [GitHub's browser-based editor](https://github.dev/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank}, which offers a user-friendly interface.

![The app-directory-data repository loaded on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-2.webp)

Or you can clone the repository locally and make modifications using your preferred code editor, in which you can use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data.git
```

Once you've cloned the project, you can create a new branch to which you will add all of your changes. To do this on the browser-based editor, take the following steps:

1. Click on the current branch name in the bottom left corner.
2. A menu will appear at the top of the page. Enter the name of your branch.
3. Click **Create new branch...**.

![Create a new branch on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-3.webp)

The page will reload, and your branch name will now be displayed in the bottom left corner.

### Projects with Deployments on Moonbeam and Moonriver {: #projects-with-deployments }

If a project is deployed to both Moonbeam and Moonriver, there are two different options available:

- Create a separate project structure for each deployment.
- Use a single project structure and modify the project data file for both projects.

Separate project structures should be used if:

- The two deployments have distinct representations in DefiLlama (i.e., two distinct identifiers).
- The project has two different tokens, one native to Moonbeam and one native to Moonriver.

Otherwise, either option may be used.

### Set Up the Folder Structure for Your Project {: #set-up-the-file-structure }

All configurations for each project listed in the DApp Directory are stored in the `projects` folder.

To get started, you must have a name that uniquely and properly identifies your project. Using your project name, you can take the following steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project using your unique project name.
2. In your project directory, you'll need to create:
    1. A project data file is a JSON file that defines all your project data and contains references to the images stored in the `logos` and `screenshots` folders. The list of fields you can use to define your data, with descriptions, is outlined in the next section. The file must be named using your unique project name.
    2. A `logos` folder where your project logo images are stored.
    3. (Optional) A `screenshots` folder where screenshots for the project are stored.

??? code "Example folder structure"

    ```text
    my-project
├── my-project.json
├── logos

│   └── my-project-logo-full.jpeg
└── screenshots

    ├── my-project-screenshot1-full.jpeg
    ├── my-project-screenshot2-small.jpeg
    └── my-project-screenshot2-full.jpeg
    ```

![The file structure displayed on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-4.webp)

With the foundational file structure in place, you're ready to populate the necessary information for your project submission.

### Add Information to the Project Data File {: #add-information }

Your project's data file is where you'll add all the information for your project. The file permits the following top-level properties:

| <div style="width:10vw">Property</div> |                         Type                          |                                                                                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                                                                                       |

In particular, if the project is listed in DefiLlama, this value should be set to the DefiLlama identifier. See the [Configure the Data Source for TVL](#configure-tvl) section for more information                                                  |

#### URLs {: #urls }

The `urls` property name/value pairs are used so a project can provide links to their website, socials, etc.

The following table lists the supported `urls` properties:

| Property Name |                                                    Description                                                     |                     Example                     |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|
|   `website`   |                                          The main website for the project                                          |            https://moonbeam.network/            |
|     `try`     | URL a user should visit if they want to try out the dApp. Typically, this page will have a link to launch the dApp |            https://moonbeam.network/            |
|   `twitter`   |                                     The project's X (Twitter) profile                                      |       https://x.com/MoonbeamNetwork       |
|   `medium`    |                                             The project's Medium site                                              |       https://medium.com/moonbeam-network       |
|  `telegram`   |                                               The project's Telegram                                               |         https://t.me/Moonbeam_Official          |
|   `github`    |                                          The project's GitHub repository                                           | https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam |
|   `discord`   |                                               The project's Discord                                                |       https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX        |

The format of the property name/value pairs should follow the JSON standard, for example:

```json
"urls": {
    "website": "https://moonbeam.network/",
    "try": "https://docs.moonbeam.network/",
    "twitter": "https://x.com/MoonbeamNetwork"
}
```

#### Logos {: #logos }

The `logos` property of the main project data file is a map of image sizes (i.e., `small`, `large`, `full`) to corresponding image JSON objects. The image JSON object contains the display properties for the given image.

The following table lists the properties of the image JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                                                       Description                                                                        |
|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `fileName` | String |                                         The name of the image file (unqualified) stored in the `logos` directory                                         |
|  `width`   |  int   |                                                          The width of the logo image in pixels                                                           |
|  `height`  |  int   |                                                          The height of the logo image in pixels                                                          |
| `mimeType` | String | The standard [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types){target=\_blank} of the file. E.g., `"image/jpeg"` |

Currently, only the `small` size is utilized, and the dimensions for small logos should be 40x40 pixels.

Here is an example showing the structure of the `logo` property that supplies `small` and `full` logos:

```json
"logo": {
    "small": {
        "fileName": "my-project-logo-small.jpeg",
        "width": 40,
        "height": 40,
        "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
    },
    "full": {
        "fileName": "my-project-logo-full.jpeg",
        "width": 3000,
        "height": 3000,
        "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
    }
}
```

#### Screenshots {: #screenshots }

The `screenshots` property of the main project data file is an array of maps. Each map in the array is for a specific screenshot.

However, different-sized images for each screenshot should be supplied so that different sizes can be used in different contexts (e.g., thumbnails vs full-sized images). Thus, for each screenshot, there is a map of image sizes (i.e., `small`, `large`, `full`) to corresponding image JSON objects. The image JSON object contains the display properties for the given image.

The following table lists the properties of the image JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                                                       Description                                                                        |
|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `fileName` | String |                                      The name of the image file (unqualified) stored in the `screenshots` directory                                      |
|  `width`   |  int   |                                                          The width of the logo image in pixels                                                           |
|  `height`  |  int   |                                                          The height of the logo image in pixels                                                          |
| `mimeType` | String | The standard [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types){target=\_blank} of the file. E.g., `"image/jpeg"` |

Here is an example showing the structure of the `screenshot` property for two screenshots (`screenshot1` and `screenshot2`):

```json
"screenshots": [
    {
        "small": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot1-small.png",
            "width": 429,
            "height": 200,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        },
        "full": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot1-full.png",
            "width": 514,
            "height": 300,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        }
    },
    {
        "small": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot2-small.png",
            "width": 429,
            "height": 200,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        },
        "full": {
            "fileName": "my-project-screenshot2-full.png",
            "width": 1716,
            "height": 800,
            "mimeType": "image/png"
        }
    }
]
```

#### Contracts {: #contracts }

A list of contracts for the project. Currently, this is used only for token contracts.

The smart contracts that make up the protocol are sourced from [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io){target=\_blank} based on tagging, so they do not need to be listed here. If you have not properly labeled your contracts or are unsure if they are labeled according to the Moonbeam community standard, please refer to the [Configure the Data Source for Active Users and Transaction Volume](#configure-active-users) section.

The following table lists the properties found in the contract JSON object:

|  Property  |  Type  |                                  Description                                  |
|:----------:|:------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `contract` | String |                      The address for the smart contract                       |
|  `chain`   | String | The chain on which the contract is deployed (i.e., `moonbeam` or `moonriver`) |
|   `name`   | String |                           The name of the contract                            |

Here is a `contracts` array with a single smart contract for the WGLMR token:

```json
"contracts": [
    {
        "contract": "0xAcc15dC74880C9944775448304B263D191c6077F",
        "chain": "moonbeam",
        "name": "Wrapped GLMR Token"
    }
]
```

### Submit a Pull Request {: #submit-a-pull-request }

After you've populated the project data file and added your logos and screenshots, you should be ready to submit your pull request.

![All of the project files added on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-5.webp)

From the web-based editor, take the following steps to commit your changes to the `app-directory-data` repository:

2. Review the files under the **Changes** section. Click the **+** button next to **Changes**, or as you review each file, click the **+** button next to the file name to add them to the list of **Staged Changes**.

![Staging the changed files on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-6.webp)

All of your files should now be under the **Staged Changes** section. All you have to commit and push the changes are:

1. Enter a descriptive commit message, such as "Add My Project", making sure to use your actual project name.
2. Click **Commit & Push**.

![Committing the staged files on GitHub's browser-based editor](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-7.webp)

Now that you've committed the changes, you'll need to head over to the [`app-directory-data` repository](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/app-directory-data){target=\_blank} and open a pull request against the `develop` branch:

1. At the top of the repository page, click **Compare and Pull** button displayed on the banner, or
2. If the banner is not there anymore, you'll need to select your branch from the branches dropdown.
3. Click the **Contribute** dropdown.

You'll be taken to the **Comparing changes** page, where you'll need to:

1. Make sure that you are merging your branch into the `develop` branch, which is the **base** branch.
2. Add a title.
3. Add a description of the changes.
4. Click **Create pull request**.

![Submit a pull request on the Comparing changes page of the app-directory-data repository on GitHub](/images/learn/dapps-list/directory-9.webp)

### The Review Process {: #review-process }

Submitted pull requests will be reviewed bi-weekly by the Moonbeam Foundation. During the review, and especially for new projects, the Foundation may have to verify that the GitHub user who created the pull request is a contributor and/or represents the specific project. One way projects can expedite this process is if the submitter's GitHub account is also a major contributor to the project itself on GitHub. Alternatively, teams should leave a note in the pull request comments indicating how we can get in touch with project team members to verify.

A comment will be added to the pull request if any changes are requested. After your pull request has been approved, it will be merged, and your project will be added to the Moonbeam DApp Directory!

## How to Update Your Project Listing {: #how-to-update-your-project-listing }

As your project evolves, you may need to update your project's listing or images related to your listing. You can create a new branch for your changes, find and modify your existing project's data from the root `projects` directory, and make the desired changes.

If you are no longer using a logo or screenshot, please remember to remove it from the `logos` or `screenshots` directory.

Once your changes have been made, you must follow the same instructions in the [Submit a Pull Request](#submit-a-pull-request) section so the changes can be [reviewed](#review-process) by the Moonbeam Foundation. Please note that pull requests are reviewed on a bi-weekly basis, so if the update is urgent, you can create a [forum post](https://forum.moonbeam.network){target=\_blank} asking for assistance.

## DApp Directory API {: #dapp-directory-api }

The DApp Directory also features a queryable API that you can use to integrate data from Moonbeam's DApp Directory into your application. The API is public and currently does not require authentication. The base URL for the API is as follows:

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/
```

### Query a Project {: #query-a-project}

You can retrieve all the information for a particular project by appending `/projects/INSERT_PROJECT_NAME` to the base URL. If you need clarification on the project name, you can omit the project name as shown below to retrieve data for every listed project and find the project in the response. 

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects
```

Here's an example of querying the API for StellaSwap, which returns the project description, social media information, user counts, relevant smart contract addresses, market data, images, and more. 

```bash
https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects/stellaswap
```

You can visit the query URL directory in the browser, using a tool like Postman, or directly from the command line with Curl as follows: 

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET 'https://apps.moonbeam.network/api/ds/v1/app-dir/projects/stellaswap'
```

# Historical Updates

## Introduction {: #introduction }

This page overviews historical updates on Moonbeam and Moonriver, such as bug fixes to the Moonbeam source code and data migrations applied.

This page aims to provide information about unexpected behaviors or data inconsistencies associated with updates that require forced data migrations.

## Bugs {: #bugs }

#### Invalid Transactions Stored {: #invalid-transactions-stored }

For invalid transactions where the transaction cost couldn't be paid, the EVM pallet inserted the transaction metadata into storage instead of discarding it because there was no transaction cost validation. As a result, the runtime storage was unnecessarily bloated with invalid transaction data.

This bug only impacted Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----:|:--------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT600 |      0 - 455106      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT600 |      0 - 675175      |

#### Ethereum Fees Weren't Sent to Treasury {: #ethereum-fees-to-treasury }

The Moonbeam transaction fee model before Runtime 3401 and the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank} mandated a 20% allocation of fees sent to the on-chain Treasury and 80% burned as a deflationary force. However, before runtime 800, Ethereum transactions did not correctly allocate 20% of the transaction fees to the on-chain Treasury.

This bug only impacted Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----:|:--------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT800 |      0 - 684728      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT800 |      0 - 915684      |

For more information, you can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/732){target=\_blank}.

---

#### Missing Refunds {: #missing-refunds }

Moonbeam is configured to set the existential deposit to 0, meaning that accounts do not need a minimum balance to be considered active. For Substrate-based chains with this configuration, some refunds were missing from zeroed accounts because the account was interpreted as not existing.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT1001 |       0 - 5164       |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT1001 |     0 - 1052241      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT1001 |     0 - 1285915      |

For more information, you can review the [relative Frontier PR](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/pull/509){target=\_blank} and the associated [Substrate PR on GitHub](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/10117){target=\_blank}.

---

#### Incorrect Collator Selection {: #incorrect-collator-selection }

The total delegations for collator candidates were not correctly updated when a delegation was increased via the `delegatorBondMore` extrinsic. This led to issues where the increased delegation amount wasn't included in the candidates' total amount bonded, which is used to determine which candidates are in the active set of collators. As a result, some candidates may not have been selected to be in the active set when they should have been, impacting their own and their delegators' rewards.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT1300 |      0 - 524762      |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT1300 |     0 - 1541735      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT1300 |     0 - 1761128      |

#### New Account Event Bug {: #new-account-event }

The `System.NewAccount` event is emitted when a new account is created. However, a bug prevented this event from being emitted for some accounts at creation time. A hotfix was applied that patched the impacted accounts and emitted the `System.NewAccount` at a later time.

The hotfix was applied in the following block ranges:

|    Network     |                                                              Block Range                                                              |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    | [1041355 - 1041358 and 1100752](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/extrinsic?module=evm&call=hotfix_inc_account_sufficients){target=\_blank} |
|   Moonriver    |      [1835760 - 1835769](https://moonriver.subscan.io/extrinsic?module=evm&call=hotfix_inc_account_sufficients){target=\_blank}       |
| Moonbase Alpha |  [2097782 - 2097974](https://moonbase.subscan.io/extrinsic?address=&module=evm&call=hotfix_inc_account_sufficients){target=\_blank}   |

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT1401 |      0 - 915320      |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT1401 |     0 - 1705939      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT1400 |     0 - 1962557      |

#### Incorrect Timestamp Units {: #incorrect-timestamp-units }

EIP-2612 and Ethereum blocks deal with timestamps in seconds; however, the Substrate timestamp pallet that Moonbeam implements uses milliseconds. This only affected the EIP-2612 implementation, not the `block.timestamp` value.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT1606 |     0 - 1326697      |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT1605 |     0 - 2077598      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT1603 |     0 - 2285346      |

For more information, you can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/1451){target=\_blank}.

---

#### Substrate Tips Missing Treasury Distribution {: #substrate-tips }

Tips for Substrate-based transactions weren't handled properly. The entire portion of the tip was burned because it was not handled in the runtime code. A fix was applied so that 20% was paid to the Treasury and 80% was burned, consistent with all other fee behavior at that time.

Note that RT3401 introduced a parameters pallet fee configuration allowing governance to adjust how fees are split between the Treasury and burning. After this runtime upgrade combined with the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank}, 100% of all transaction fees on both Moonbeam and Moonriver are now burned.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT900    | RT2403 |     0 - 4163078      |
|   Moonriver    |    RT49    | RT2401 |     0 - 4668844      |
| Moonbase Alpha |    RT40    | RT2401 |     0 - 4591616      |

For more information, you can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/2291){target=\_blank}.

#### Incorrect Delegation Reward Calculation {: #incorrect-delegation-reward-calculation }

The reward payouts for all delegations and collators were underestimated whenever there were pending requests. Delegation rewards are calculated based on the amount of tokens bonded by each delegator with respect to the total stake of the given collator. By counting delegation amounts for pending requests, the rewards to collators and their delegations were less than they should have been.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1001   | RT1802 |    5165 - 1919457    |
|   Moonriver    |   RT1001   | RT1801 |  1052242 - 2572555   |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1001   | RT1800 |  1285916 - 2748785   |

You can review the [relative PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/1719){target=\_blank} for more information.

#### Block Parent Hash Calculated Incorrectly {: #block-parent-hash-calculated-incorrectly }

After EIP-1559 support was introduced, which included the transition to new Ethereum transaction types, the block header parent hash was miscalculated to `H256::default`.

This bug only impacted Moonbase Alpha and only impacted the following block:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------:|
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1200   | RT1201 |    1648995     |

While the root issue was fixed in RT1201, the incorrect hash was corrected in RT2601.

For more information on the root fix, you can review the [relative Frontier PR on GitHub](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/pull/570/){target=\_blank}. To take a look at the correction of the parent hash, check out the corresponding [Moonbeam PR on GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/pull/2524){target=\_blank}.

#### Incorrect Handling of EIP-1559 Gas Fees {: #incorrect-gas-fees-eip1559 }

With the introduction of EIP-1559 support, the logic for handling `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` was implemented incorrectly. As a result, the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` was added to the `baseFee` even if the total amount was over the `maxFeePerGas`.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1201   | RT1401 |   415946 - 915320    |
|   Moonriver    |   RT1201   | RT1401 |  1471037 - 1705939   |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1200   | RT1400 |  1648994 - 1962557   |

#### Transaction Fees Paid to Collators {: #transaction-fees-paid-to-collators }

For blocks that included EIP-1559 transactions where a priority fee was applied, the transaction fees were incorrectly calculated and distributed to the block's collator. The fee model on Moonbeam for transactions and smart contract execution was previously handled so that 20% of the fees went to the on-chain Treasury and 80% were burned as a deflationary force. Due to this bug, the transaction fees of the impacted transactions were not burned as expected.

Note that RT3401 introduced a parameters pallet fee configuration allowing governance to adjust how fees are split between the Treasury and burning. After this runtime upgrade combined with the passage of [MB101](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb101-burn-100-of-transaction-fees-on-moonbeam/2022){target=\_blank}, 100% of all transaction fees on both Moonbeam and Moonriver are now burned.

#### Incorrect State Root Hash {: #incorrect-state-root-hash }

The state root hash was miscalculated for non-legacy transactions as the transaction-type byte was not considered. With the support of [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930){target=\_blank} and [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank}, the transaction types introduced are `0x01` (1) and `0x02` (2), respectively. These transaction types were omitted from the state root hash calculation.

#### Ethereum Transactions Duplicated in Storage {: #ethereum-transactions-duplicated-in-storage }

An upstream bug was introduced to Frontier in the Ethereum Pallet, causing pending transactions that existed during a runtime upgrade to be duplicated in storage across two different blocks. This only impacted the first two blocks after the runtime upgrade in which this bug was introduced.

Only Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha were impacted. The bug was introduced in the following runtimes and affected the following blocks:

|    Network     | Introduced |   Impacted Blocks   |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-------------------:|
|   Moonriver    |   RT1605   | 2077599 and 2077600 |
| Moonbase Alpha |   RT1603   | 2285347 and 2285348 |

The following transactions were duplicated:

#### Gas Limit Too High for Non-Transactional Calls {: #gas-limit-too-high-for-non-transactional-calls }

When a non-transactional call, such as `eth_call` or `eth_estimateGas`, is made without specifying a gas limit for a past block, the client defaults to using the gas limit multiplier (10x), which causes the gas limit validation to fail as it is validating against an upper bound of the block gas limit. So, if the gas limit is greater than the block gas limit for a given call, a gas limit too high error is returned.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |   RT1701   | RT1802 |  1581457 - 1919457   |

#### Remote EVM Calls Return Identical Transaction Hashes {: #remote-evm-calls-return-identical-tx-hashes }

When multiple remote EVM calls were sent from different accounts with the same transaction payload and nonce, the same transaction hash was returned for each call. This was possible because remote EVM calls are executed from a keyless account, so if the senders all had the same nonce and were sending the same transaction object, there was no differentiation in the calculation of the transaction hash. This was fixed by adding a global nonce to the Ethereum XCM Pallet, which is the pallet that makes remote EVM calls possible.

This bug only existed on Moonbase Alpha during the following runtimes and block ranges:

|    Network     | Introduced | Fixed  | Impacted Block Range |

#### Gas Estimation Discrepancy {: #gas-estimation-discrepancy }

There was a difference between estimating the gas for a transaction using a non-transaction call, such as `eth_call`, and the execution of it on-chain. The discrepancy occurred because the non-transactional calls were not properly accounting for `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, as such, the ([Proof of Validity](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/glossary/#proof-of-validity){target=\_blank}) consumed by the Ethereum transaction was counted differently. This was fixed by properly accounting for these fields when estimating the size of the on-chain transaction.

#### Incorrect Effective Gas Price In Transaction Receipts {: #incorrect-effective-gas-price }

The `effectiveGasPrice` value returned by `eth_getTransactionReceipt` was different from the on-chain value due to an incorrect calculation of the base fee. Specifically, the transaction receipt's value was computed using the `NextFeeMultiplier` from the block in which the transaction was included rather than the previous block, which is the correct source for computing the base fee.

This bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

#### Skipped Ethereum Transaction Traces {: #skipped-ethereum-transaction-traces }

Runtimes with the `evm-tracing` feature enabled introduced additional `ref_time` overhead due to special logic that traces Ethereum transactions (emitting events for each component: gasometer, runtime, EVM) used to fill information for RPC calls like `debug_traceTransaction` and `trace_filter`. 

Since the real `ref_time` in production runtimes is smaller, this could cause the block weight limits to be reached when replaying a block in an EVM-tracing runtime, resulting in skipped transaction traces. This was observed in Moonbeam block [9770044](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/block/9770044){target=\_blank}.

The fix consisted of resetting the previously consumed weight before tracing each Ethereum transaction. It's important to note that this issue only affected code under `evm-tracing`, which is not included in any production runtime.

This bug was fixed in the following runtime:

#### Notify Inactive Collator Fails for Long-Inactive Collators {: #notify-inactive-collator-fails }

The `notifyInactiveCollator` extrinsic, designed to remove collators from the pool if they haven't produced any blocks in the last two rounds, failed for collators who had been inactive for significantly longer than two rounds. The transaction would only succeed within the first few blocks of a new round.

The bug existed during the following runtimes and block ranges:

A migration was applied that updated the `Collator` storage item of the parachain staking pallet to the new `Collator2` storage item. This change updated the collator state to include the following items:

- The `nominators` set is a list of all of the nominator (delegator) account IDs without their respective balance bonded
- A new `top_nominators` storage item that returns a list of all of the top nominators ordered by greatest bond amount to least
- A new `bottom_nominators` storage item that returns a list of all of the bottom nominators ordered by least bond amount to greatest
- The `total` storage item was replaced with `total_counted` and `total_backing`. The `total_counted` item returns the sum of the top nominations and the collator's self-bond, whereas the `total_backing` item returns the sum of all of the nominations and the collator's self-bond

This migration was only applied to Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|   Moonriver    |       RT53       |     9696      |

#### Patch Total Staked Amount {: #patch-total-staked-amount }

A migration was applied to the `total` staked amount of the `CollatorState` storage item in the Parachain Staking Pallet due to a potential bug that may have led to an incorrect amount.

This migration was only applied to Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |

#### Support Delayed Nominator (Delegator) Exits {: #support-delayed-nominator-exits }

The exit queue for handling candidate exits had been updated to include support for delayed nominator (delegator) exits and revocations, which required a migration to update the `ExitQueue` parachain staking pallet storage item to `ExitQueue2`. The `NominatorState` storage item was also migrated to `NominatorState2` to prevent a nominator from performing more nominations when they already have scheduled an exit.

These migrations were only applied to Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|   Moonriver    |      RT200       |    259002     |

#### Purge Staking Storage Bloat {: #purge-staking-storage-bloat }

A migration was applied to purge staking storage bloat for the `Points` and `AtStake` storage items of the parachain staking pallet that are older than two rounds.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |

#### Support Manual Exits and DPoS Terminology {: #support-manual-exits-dpos-terminology }

The parachain staking pallet was updated to include manual exits. If a candidate or delegator wanted to decrease or revoke their bond or leave the candidate or delegator pool, they would need to schedule a request first, wait for a delay period to pass, and then manually execute the request. As such, a migration was applied to replace the automatic exit queue, including the `ExitQueue2` storage item, with a manual exits API.

In addition, a change was made to switch from Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) to Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) terminology; this marked the sweeping change from "nominate" to "delegate". This required the migration of the following parachain staking pallet storage items:

- `CollatorState2` was migrated to `CandidateState`
- `NominatorState2` was migrated to `DelegatorState`

These migrations were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1001      |     5165      |

#### Split Candidate Delegations into Top and Bottom {: #split-candidate-delegations-top-bottom }

This migration splits the deprecated `CandidateState` storage item of the parachain staking pallet into the following three new storage items to avoid unnecessary storage reads:

- `CandidateInfo`
- `TopDelegations`
- `BottomDelegations`

#### Auto-Compounding Support {: #auto-compounding-support }

To support auto-compounding, two migrations were applied to the `AtStake` storage item in the parachain staking pallet:

- `RemovePaidRoundsFromAtStake` - to remove any stale `AtStake` entries relating to already paid-out rounds with candidates that didn't produce any blocks. This migration is a prerequisite for the `MigrateAtStakeAutoCompound` migration
- `MigrateAtStakeAutoCompound` - migrates the snapshots for unpaid rounds for `AtStake` entries

These migrations were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

#### Renaming of Parachain Bond Reserve Events {: #renaming-of-parachain-bond-reserve-events }

Prior to Runtime 3300, the `ReservedForParachainBond` event was emitted once per round to indicate parachain bond reserve funding through inflation. In Runtime 3300, this same event was renamed to `InflationDistributed`.

This change took effect at the following runtimes and blocks:

#### ParachainStaking: Currency → Fungible Migration {: #parachainstaking-currency-to-fungible }

A migration was applied to move the `ParachainStaking` pallet from the deprecated Currency trait to the modern Fungible trait. Operationally, staking “locks” were replaced by balance “freezes”: queries that previously read `Balances.Locks` with identifiers [`stkngcol`, `stkngdel`] must now read `Balances.Freezes` with freeze reasons [`StakingCollator`, `StakingDelegator`]. The frozen balance shown in `System.Account` is unchanged by this migration.

### Referenda Pallet {: #referenda-pallet }

#### Refunds for Submission Deposits {: #refunds-for-submission-deposits }

A migration was introduced to support refunds for submission deposits on closed referenda that updated the `ReferendumInfo` type. The following invariants of `ReferendumInfo` were changed so that the second parameter, `Deposit<AccountId, Balance>`, is now optional, `Option<Deposit<AccountId, Balance>>`: `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Cancelled`, and `TimedOut`.

This stemmed from an upstream change to the [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12788){target=\_blank} repository.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |

#### Restore Corrupted Referenda Deposits {: restore-corrupted-referenda-deposits }

A migration was introduced to support restoring referenda deposits affected by corrupted storage values. The issue arose when a migration was applied twice due to a pallet version error, resulting in invalid values and non-refundable submission deposits. As the number of values to correct was finite and small, this migration created a list to update them by hand.

This migration was only applied to Moonbeam and was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

| Network  | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| Moonbeam |      RT3100      |    7303601    |

### XCM-Related Pallets {: #xcm-related-pallets }

#### Update Transact Info Storage Item {: #update-transaction-info }

There was a migration applied to the `TransactInfo` storage item of the XCM Transactor Pallet that changed the following items:

- `max_weight` is added to prevent transactors from stalling the queue in the destination chain
- Removes `fee_per_byte`, `metadata_size`, and `base_weight` as these items are not necessary for XCM transactions
- `fee_per_second` replaces `fee_per_weight` to better reflect cases (like Kusama) in which the `fee_per_weight` unit is lower than one

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|

#### Add Support for Kusama Asset Hub (Statemine) Prefix Breaking Change {: #add-support-statemine-prefix }

The following three migrations were added to the asset manager pallet to avoid issues with Kusama Asset Hub's (previously referred to as Statemine) [breaking change to the way it represents assets](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/831){target=\_blank} and possible future breaking changes:

- `UnitsWithAssetType` - updates the `AssetTypeUnitsPerSecond` storage item to a mapping of the `AssetType` to `units_per_second`, instead of the mapping `AssetId` to `units_per_second`. This is done to avoid additional migrations whenever a breaking change arises
- `PopulateAssetTypeIdStorage` - creates a new `AssetTypeId` storage item that holds the `AssetType` to `AssetId` mapping, which allows the decoupling of `assetIds` and `AssetTypes`
- `ChangeStateminePrefixes` - updates already registered Kusama Asset Hub (Statemine) assets to their new form

These migrations were executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1201      |    415946     |

#### Add New Supported Fee Payment Assets Storage Item {: #add-supported-fee-payment-assets }

A migration was applied to the asset manager pallet, creating a new `SupportedFeePaymentAssets` storage item by reading the supported asset data from the `AssetTypeUnitsPerSecond` storage item. This storage item will hold all the assets we accept for XCM fee payment. It will be read when an incoming XCM message is received, and if the asset is not in storage, the message will not be processed.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
|    Moonbeam    |      RT1300      |    524762     |

#### Update the XCM Transactor Storage from V2 to V3 {: #update-xcm-transactor }

With the support of XCM V3, a migration was applied to update the XCM Transactor pallet's storage from XCM V2 to V3. The `transactInfoWithWeightLimit` and `destinationAssetFeePerSecond` storage items were updated to support XCM V3 multilocations.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

#### Remove Mintable XC-20s {: #remove-local-assets }

Mintable XC-20s were deprecated in favor of XCM-enabled ERC-20s; as such, a migration was applied to remove the local assets pallet and clear the assets in storage.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |

#### Manage Foreign Assets via Smart Contracts  {: #foreign-assets-migration }

A migration was applied to transition existing foreign assets to a new design that manages XCM derivative assets on Moonbeam through EVM smart contracts instead of the previous implementation using the Asset and Asset Manager pallets. The migration process involved several extrinsics in the Moonbeam Lazy Migration pallet:

- **`approve_assets_to_migrate`** - sets the list of asset IDs approved for migration
- **`start_foreign_asset_migration`** - initiates migration for a specific foreign asset by freezing the original asset and creating a new EVM smart contract
- **`migrate_foreign_asset_balances`** - migrates asset balances in batches from old assets pallet to the new system
- **`migrate_foreign_asset_approvals`** - migrates asset approvals in batches while unreserving deposits from the old approval system
- **`finish_foreign_asset_migration`** - completes migration after all balances and approvals are migrated and performs final cleanup

This migration preserves compatibility with existing foreign assets by identifying each foreign asset with the same AssetID integer as before. This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|

### Nimbus Author Filter Pallet {: #nimbus }

#### Replace Eligible Ratio with Eligible Count {: #replace-eligible-ratio }

A breaking change was applied to the Nimbus repository, deprecating `EligibleRatio` in favor of the `EligibleCount` config. As a result, a migration was applied to the Moonbeam repository, populating the new `EligibleCount` value as a percentage of the potential authors defined at that block height if the `EligibleRatio` value existed. Otherwise, the value was set to a default value of `50`.

This migration was executed at the following runtimes and blocks:

|    Network     | Executed Runtime | Block Applied |

# Runtime Upgrades

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam runtime upgrades allow for the maintenance and evolution of the chain logic without the need for a hard fork. These runtime upgrades can introduce new features, improve performance, fix bugs, and respond to changing requirements.

This page provides a historical record of runtime upgrades by block for each of the Moonbeam-based networks.

## Runtime Upgrades by Block {: #runtime-upgrades-by-block }

The following table contains a list of the runtime upgrades and the block at which the upgrade occurred for each network. Runtime upgrades occur first on Moonbase Alpha before being released on Moonriver and then on Moonbeam. You can read the release notes for each runtime on the [Moonbeam releases GitHub page](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases){target=\_blank}.

Not all runtime upgrades are released on each network, as sometimes after releasing the initial runtime upgrade, the need for a subsequent upgrade arises. If a runtime upgrade version has been skipped or hasn't been released yet (only applicable to the latest runtime upgrade), you'll see a `-` in that row.

# Supported Ethereum RPC Methods

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Moonbeam team has collaborated closely with [Parity](https://www.parity.io){target=\_blank} on developing [Frontier](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/){target=\_blank}, an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate-based chains. This layer enables developers to run unmodified Ethereum dApps on Moonbeam seamlessly.

Nevertheless, not all Ethereum JSON-RPC methods are supported; some of those supported return default values (those related to Ethereum's PoW consensus mechanism in particular). This guide provides a comprehensive list of supported Ethereum JSON-RPC methods on Moonbeam. Developers can quickly reference this list to understand the available functionality for interfacing with Moonbeam's Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

## Default Block Parameters {: #default-block-parameters }

Moonbeam supports several default block parameters that allow you to query a subset of JSON-RPC methods at significant block heights. Moonbeam supports the following default block parameters: 

- `finalized` - Refers to the most recent block that Polkadot validators have finalized
- `safe` - Synonymous with `finalized` in Moonbeam. In Ethereum, `safe` refers to the most recent block that is considered safe by the network, meaning it is unlikely to be reverted but has not yet been finalized. With Moonbeam's fast and deterministic finality, `finalized` and `safe` refer to the same blocks. 
- `earliest` - Refers to the genesis block of the blockchain
- `pending` - Represents the latest state, including pending transactions that have not yet been mined into a block. This is a live view of the mempool
- `latest` - Refers to the latest confirmed block in the blockchain, which may not be finalized

## Unsupported Ethereum JSON-RPC Methods {: #unsupported-rpc-methods }

Moonbeam does not support the following Ethereum API JSON-RPC methods:

 - **[eth_getProof](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/ethereum/ethereum-api-endpoints/eth-get-proof){target=\_blank}** - returns the account and storage values of the specified account including the Merkle-proof
 - **[eth_blobBaseFee](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/ethereum/eth_blobBaseFee){target=\_blank}** - returns the expected base fee for blobs in the next block
 - **[eth_createAccessList](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/node/ethereum/ethereum-api-endpoints/eth-create-access-list){target=\_blank}** - creates an EIP-2930 type `accessList` based on a given transaction object
 - **[eth_sign](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_sign){target=\_blank}** - allows the user to sign an arbitrary hash to be sent at a later time. Presents a [security risk](https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/what-is-eth_sign-and-why-is-it-a-risk/){target=\_blank} as the arbitrary hash can be fraudulently applied to other transactions
 - **[eth_signTransaction](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_signtransaction){target=\_blank}** - allows the user to sign a transaction to be sent at a later time. It is rarely used due to associated security risks

# Moonbeam Custom API

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam nodes include support for custom JSON-RPC endpoints: 

- `moon_isBlockFinalized` 
- `moon_isTxFinalized`
- `moon_getEthSyncBlockRange`

These endpoints provide valuable functionality for checking the finality of on-chain events.

To begin exploring Moonbeam's custom JSON-RPC endpoints, you can try out the provided curl examples below. These examples demonstrate how to query the public RPC endpoint of Moonbase Alpha. However, you can easily modify them to use with your own Moonbeam or Moonriver endpoint by changing the URL and API key. If you haven't already, you can obtain your endpoint and API key from one of our supported [Endpoint Providers](/builders/get-started/endpoints/){target=\_blank}.

# Overview of the Precompiled Contracts on Moonbeam

## Overview {: #introduction }

On Moonbeam, a precompiled contract is native Substrate code that has an Ethereum-style address and can be called using the Ethereum API, like any other smart contract. The precompiles allow you to call the Substrate runtime directly which is not normally accessible from the Ethereum side of Moonbeam.

The Substrate code responsible for implementing precompiles can be found in the [EVM pallet](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/){target=\_blank}. The EVM pallet includes the [standard precompiles found on Ethereum and some additional precompiles that are not specific to Ethereum](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm/precompile){target=\_blank}. It also provides the ability to create and execute custom precompiles through the generic [`Precompiles` trait](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/rustdocs/pallet_evm/trait.Precompile.html){target=\_blank}. There are several custom Moonbeam-specific precompiles that have been created, all of which can be found in the [Moonbeam codebase](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/tree/master/precompiles){target=\_blank}. It is important to highlight that the precompiles from this list with the `CallableByContract` check are not callable inside the contract constructor.

The Ethereum precompiled contracts contain complex functionality that is computationally intensive, such as hashing and encryption. The custom precompiled contracts on Moonbeam provide access to Substrate-based functionality such as staking, governance, XCM-related functions, and more.

The Moonbeam-specific precompiles can be interacted with through familiar and easy-to-use Solidity interfaces using the Ethereum API, which are ultimately used to interact with the underlying Substrate interface. This flow is depicted in the following diagram:

![Precompiled Contracts Diagram](/images/builders/ethereum/precompiles/overview/overview-1.webp)

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam. Please refer to the [Security Considerations](/learn/core-concepts/security/){target=\_blank} page for more information.

## Precompiled Contract Addresses {: #precompiled-contract-addresses }

The precompiled contracts are categorized by address and based on the origin network. If you were to convert the precompiled addresses to decimal format, and break them into categories by numeric value, the categories are as follows:

- **0-1023** - [Ethereum MainNet precompiles](#ethereum-mainnet-precompiles)
- **1024-2047** - precompiles that are [not in Ethereum and not Moonbeam specific](#non-moonbeam-specific-nor-ethereum-precomiles)
- **2048-4095** - [Moonbeam specific precompiles](#moonbeam-specific-precompiles)

# Network Endpoints

## Public Endpoints {: #public-endpoints }

Moonbeam-based networks have two endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

The endpoints in this section are for development purposes only and are not meant to be used in production applications.

If you are looking for an API provider suitable for production use, you can check out the [Endpoint Providers](#endpoint-providers) section of this guide.

## Lazy Loading with RPC Endpoint Providers {: #lazy-loading-with-RPC-Endpoint-Providers }

Lazy loading lets a Moonbeam node operate while downloading network state in the background, eliminating the need to wait for full synchronization before use. To spin up a Moonbeam node with lazy loading, you'll need to either [download the Moonbeam release binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/systemd/#the-release-binary){target=_blank} or [compile the binary](/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/compile-binary/#compile-the-binary){target=_blank}. You can activate lazy loading with the following flag:

`--lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT-RPC-URL'`

Lazy loading is highly resource-intensive, requiring many RPC requests to function. To avoid being throttled, it's recommended that you use a [dedicated endpoint](#endpoint-providers) (i.e., an endpoint with an API key) rather than a public endpoint. You will likely be rate-limited if you use lazy loading with a public endpoint. Upon spooling up a node with this feature, you'll see output like the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty>[Lazy loading 🌗]
    <br>You are now running the Moonbeam client in lazy loading mode, where data is retrieved
    <br>from a live RPC node on demand.
    <br>Using remote state from: https://moonbeam.unitedbloc.com
    <br>Forking from block: 8482853
    <br>To ensure the client works properly, please note the following:
    <br>    1. *Avoid Throttling*: Ensure that the backing RPC node is not limiting the number of
    <br>    requests, as this can prevent the lazy loading client from functioning correctly;
    <br>    2. *Be Patient*: As the client may take approximately 20 times longer than normal to
    <br>    retrieve and process the necessary data for the requested operation.
    <br>The service will start in 10 seconds...</span>
</div>

### Overriding State with Lazy Loading

By default, you won't see detailed logging in the terminal. To override this setting and show lazy loading logs, you can add the following flag to your command to start the Moonbeam node: `-l debug`. You can further customize your use of the lazy loading functionality with the following optional parameters:

- **`--lazy-loading-block`** - specifies a block hash from which to start loading data. If not provided, the latest block will be used
- **`--lazy-loading-delay-between-requests`** - the delay (in milliseconds) between RPC requests when using lazy loading. This parameter controls the amount of time to wait between consecutive RPC requests. This can help manage request rate and avoid overwhelming the server. Default value is `100` milliseconds
- **`--lazy-loading-max-retries-per-request`** - the maximum number of retries for an RPC request when using lazy loading. Default value is `10` retries
- **`--lazy-loading-runtime-override`** - path to a WASM file to override the runtime when forking. If not provided, it will fetch the runtime from the block being forked
- **`--lazy-loading-state-overrides`** - path to a JSON file containing state overrides to be applied when forking

#### Simple Storage Item Override

The state overrides file should define the respective pallet, storage item, and value that you seek to override as follows:

```json
[
 {
     "pallet": "System",
     "storage": "SelectedCandidates",
     "value": "0x04f24ff3a9cf04c71dbc94d0b566f7a27b94566cac"
 }
]
```

#### Override an Account's Free Balance

To override the balance of a particular account, you can override the account storage item of the system pallet for the respective account as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "pallet": "System",
    "storage": "Account",
    "key": "TARGET_ADDRESS",
    "value": "0x460c000002000000010000000600000069e10de76676d0800000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080"
  }
]
```

??? note "Details about overriding account balances"

    Overriding an account balance, as shown above, can be a complex process. However, this guide will break it down into steps that are easy to follow. Before making any changes, you should obtain the existing value corresponding to the key (i.e., the account in this case). You can go to [**Chain State** on Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network#/chainstate){target=_blank} and query the System pallet by providing the account you'd like to query. Upon submitting the query, you'll get back a readable account structure like so:

    ```text
    {
      nonce: 3,142
      consumers: 2
      providers: 1
      sufficients: 6
      data: {
        free: 1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676
        reserved: 348,052,500,000,000,000,000
        frozen: 20,413,910,106,633,175,872
        flags: 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
      }
    }
    ```

    While this is useful as a reference, the information you're looking for is the encoded storage key, which is accessible even without submitting the chain state query. In this instance, the encoded storage key corresponding to the system pallet and the selected account `0x3B939FeaD1557C741Ff06492FD0127bd287A421e` is:

    ```text
    0x26aa394eea5630e07c48ae0c9558cef7b99d880ec681799c0cf30e8886371da9b882fedb4f75b055c709ec5b66b5d9933b939fead1557c741ff06492fd0127bd287a421e
    ```

    Note that this encoded storage key will change alongside any input changes, such as a different account being queried. Then, head over the **Raw Storage** tab on [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate/raw){target=_blank}. Input the above storage key and submit the query. The response is the SCALE encoded account struct, a part of which contains the free balance information to be modified as part of this example: 

    ```text
    0x460c0000020000000100000006000000a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080
    ```

    There is quite a bit of data encoded in the value field because it is a complex struct comprised of multiple values. The struct is comprised of:

    ```text
    struct AccountInfo {
        nonce: u32,             // Transaction count
        consumers: u32,         // Number of consumers 
        providers: u32,         // Number of providers
        sufficients: u32,       // Number of sufficients
        data: AccountData {     // The balance info
            free: u128,         // Free balance
            reserved: u128,     // Reserved balance
            frozen: u128,       // Frozen balance
            flags: u128         // Account flags
        }
    }
    ```

    You can associate each part of the SCALE encoded struct with the corresponding piece of Alice's account information that it represents:

    ```text
    0x460c0000        // nonce (u32): 3,142 
    02000000          // consumers (u32): 2
    01000000          // providers (u32): 1  
    06000000          // sufficients (u32): 6

    a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045000000000000000  
    // free (u128): 1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676

    40a556b0e032de1200000000000000000  
    // reserved (u128): 348,052,500,000,000,000,000  

    4083a09e15c74c1b01000000000000000  
    // frozen (u128): 20,413,910,106,633,175,872

    00000000000000000000000000000080   
    // flags (u128): 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
    ```

    Remember that the values are little endian encoded. To convert the hexadecimal little endian encoded values to decimal, you can use [Substrate Utilities converter](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/){target=_blank}, using the **Balance to Hex (Little Endian)** converter.

    In this example, the existing free balance of `1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676` Wei or approximately `1278.60` DEV is `a4d92a6a4e6b3a5045`. The following example will change the value to `500,000` DEV, which is `500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000` Wei or `0x000080d07666e70de169` encoded as a hexadecimal little endian value. When properly padded to fit into the SCALE encoded storage value, it becomes `69e10de76676d08000000000000000000`, such that the table now looks like:

    ```text
    0x460c0000        // nonce (u32): 3,142 
    02000000          // consumers (u32): 2
    01000000          // providers (u32): 1  
    06000000          // sufficients (u32): 6

    69e10de76676d08000000000000000000
    // free (u128): 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

    40a556b0e032de1200000000000000000  
    // reserved (u128): 348,052,500,000,000,000,000  

    4083a09e15c74c1b01000000000000000  
    // frozen (u128): 20,413,910,106,633,175,872

    00000000000000000000000000000080   
    // flags (u128): 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728
    ```

    Therefore, the SCALE encoded override value is as follows:

    ```text
    0x460c000002000000010000000600000069e10de76676d0800000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080
    ```

    You can now specify the SCALE encoded override value in your `state-overrides.json` file as follows:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "pallet": "System",
        "storage": "Account",
        "key": "0x3b939fead1557c741ff06492fd0127bd287a421e",
        "value": "0x460c000002000000010000000600000069e10de76676d0800000000000000000040a556b0e032de12000000000000000004083a09e15c74c1b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080"
      }
    ]
    ```

    To run lazy loading with the balance state override, you can use the following command: 

    ```bash
    --lazy-loading-remote-rpc 'INSERT_RPC_URL' --lazy-loading-state-overrides ./state-overrides.json
    ```

#### Override an ERC-20 Token Balance

To override an ERC-20 token balance, identify the storage slot in the EVM’s AccountStorages where the `balanceOf` data for the given token contract and account is stored. This storage slot is determined by the token contract’s H160 address and the corresponding H256 storage key. Once you have this slot, specify the new balance value in the `state-overrides.json` file to implement the override.

In the example below, we override the token balance of the [Wormhole USDC Contract (`0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c`)](https://moonscan.io/address/0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c){target=_blank} for the account `0x3b939fead1557c741ff06492fd0127bd287a421e` to $5,000 USDC. Since Wormhole USDC uses 6 decimal places, $5,000 corresponds to `5000000000` in integer form, which is `0x12a05f200` in hexadecimal.

```json
[
    {
        "pallet": "EVM",
        "storage": "AccountStorages",
        "key": [
            "0x931715FEE2d06333043d11F658C8CE934aC61D0c",

You can calculate the exact storage slot to override for your own account with the following script:

```js
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

function getBalanceSlot(accountAddress) {
  // Convert address to bytes32 and normalize
  const addr = ethers.zeroPadValue(accountAddress, 32);

  // CAUTION! The storage slot used here is 5, which
  // is specific to Wormhole contracts
  // The storage slot index for other tokens may vary
  const packedData = ethers.concat([
    addr,
    ethers.zeroPadValue(ethers.toBeHex(5), 32),
  ]);

  // Calculate keccak256
  return ethers.keccak256(packedData);
}

// Example usage
const address = 'INSERT_ADDRESS';
console.log(getBalanceSlot(address));
```

You can apply the same process for other ERC-20 token contracts. The following sections demonstrate overrides for the `0x3B939FeaD1557C741Ff06492FD0127bd287A421e` account with various ERC-20 tokens. Remember to update the H160 token contract address whenever you switch to a different token. Also, you will need to recalculate the H256 storage slot for each distinct account whose balance you want to override.

??? code "Example: Override WELL Token Balance"

    Because the [WELL token](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/token/0x511ab53f793683763e5a8829738301368a2411e3){target=_blank} does not use a proxy implementation contract, the storage slot calculation differs. Instead of slot `5`, the balance mapping resides at slot `1`. You can determine the exact storage slot to override the WELL token balance for your own account using the following script:

    ```js
    import { ethers } from 'ethers';

    function getBalanceSlot(accountAddress) {
      // Convert address to bytes32 and normalize
      const addr = ethers.zeroPadValue(accountAddress, 32);

      // Caution! The storage slot index used here is 1
      // The storage slot index for other tokens may vary
      const packedData = ethers.concat([
        addr,
        ethers.zeroPadValue(ethers.toBeHex(1), 32),
      ]);

      // Calculate keccak256
      return ethers.keccak256(packedData);
    }

    // Example usage
    const address = 'INSERT_ADDRESS';
    console.log(getBalanceSlot(address));
    ```

    Thus, the storage override would be:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "pallet": "EVM",
            "storage": "AccountStorages",
            "key": [
                "0x511aB53F793683763E5a8829738301368a2411E3",
                "0x728d3daf4878939a6bb58cbc263f39655bb57ea15db7daa0b306f3bf2c3f1227"
            ],
            "value": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012a05f200"
        }
    ]
    ```

## Tracing RPC Endpoint Providers {: #tracing-providers }

Tracing RPC endpoints allow you to access non-standard RPC methods, such as those that belong to Geth's `debug` and `txpool` APIs and OpenEthereum's `trace` module. To see a list of the supported non-standard RPC methods on Moonbeam for debugging and tracing, please refer to the [Debug API & Trace Module](/builders/ethereum/json-rpc/debug-trace/){target=_blank} guide.

The following providers provide tracing RPC endpoints:

- [OnFinality](#onfinality-tracing)

### OnFinality {: #onfinality-tracing }

[OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/en){target=_blank}'s Trace API can be used to quickly get started tracing and debugging transactions on Moonbeam and Moonriver. It is only available to users on their [Growth and Ultimate plans](https://onfinality.io/en/pricing){target=_blank}.

To use the Trace API, you simply call the trace method of your choice from your [private RPC endpoint](#onfinality). For a list of the supported networks and trace methods, please check out [OnFinality's Trace API documentation](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/trace-api#TraceAPI-SupportedNetworks){target=_blank}.

Please note that if you are tracing historic blocks, it is recommended to use your own dedicated trace node to backfill any data, and then once you're caught up, you can switch to using the Trace API. You can check out the [How to Deploy a Trace Node for Moonbeam on OnFinality](https://onfinality.medium.com/how-to-deploy-a-trace-node-for-moonbeam-on-onfinality-85683181d290){target=-_blank} post for more information on how to spin up your own dedicated trace node.
