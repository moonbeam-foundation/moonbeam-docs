## Roadmap of a Treasury Proposal {: #roadmap-of-a-treasury-proposal }

The happy path of a Treasury spend request is as follows:

2. **Forum discussion** - the proposal is discussed by the community on the Forum. The ultimate Aye/Nay decision is determined by the Treasury council

3. **Treasury approval and action** - if the Treasury Council agrees, it authorizes the Treasury spending and moves the process forward
