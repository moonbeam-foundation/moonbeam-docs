Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Import the `fs` and `solc` packages
2. Using the `fs.readFileSync` function, you'll read and save the file contents of `Incrementer.sol` to `source`
3. Build the `input` object for the Solidity compiler by specifying the `language`, `sources`, and `settings` to be used
4. Using the `input` object, you can compile the contract using `solc.compile`
5. Extract the compiled contract file and export it to be used in the deployment script
