Now that your chain data has been purged, you can start a new node with a fresh data directory. You can install the newest version by repeating the [Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions). Make sure you are using the latest tag available, which you can find on the [Moonbeam GitHub Release](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases/) page.

!!! note
    On an as-needed basis, Moonbase Alpha might be purged and reset. In these instances, you will need to purge both the parachain data and the relay chain data. If a purge is required, node operators will be notified in advance (via our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/PfpUATX)).
