!!! note
    As of runtime 3000, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-async-backing/#asynchronous-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on all Moonbeam networks. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions.
