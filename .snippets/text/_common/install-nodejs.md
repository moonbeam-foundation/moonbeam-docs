You need to install Node.js (for this example, you can use v16.x) and the npm package manager. You can download directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/){target=_blank} or in your terminal:

--8<-- 'code/_commoninstall-nodejs-commands.md'

You can verify that everything is installed correctly by querying the version for each package:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
```
